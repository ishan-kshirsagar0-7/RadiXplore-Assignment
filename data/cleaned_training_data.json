Highlights. Assay results returned from 13 further holes (2,330m drilling) of the Cy2024 Phase 1 reverse circulation (Rc) drilling at GEO-01 have identified new zones of near-surface gold mineralisation. The first six RC holes from CY2024 Phase 1 GEO-01 drilling previously returned thick zones of near-surface, potentially open pittable, high-grade gold mineralisation (refer ASX announcement 14 May 2024).  The current round of results has increased the main zone of GEO-01 mineralisation to 500m along strike (previously 250m) and up to 190m across strike (previously 150m)..  Significant intersections include: 26m at 0.7 g/t gold from 16m down hole in 24MYc0449, including:.  11m at 1.2 g/t gold from 17m down hole - 1m at 1.3 g/t gold from 38m down hole 17m at 0.5 g/t gold from 49m down hole in 24MYC0454, including:. 8m at 1.0 g/t gold from 53m down hole, also including:.  2m at 3.2 g/t gold and 0.04% copper from 55m -12m at 0.5 g/t gold from 132m down hole in 24MYc0462 (EoH 150m), including: - 4m at 1.4 g/t gold from 136m down hole  8m at 0.5 g/t gold from 165m down hole in 24MYc0449, including:.  2m at 1.2 g/t gold from 169m down hole The recently completed Phase 1 programme was expanded to a total of 81 holes for 13,122m, a direct result of the positive outcomes from the assay results received to date (19 holes). GEO-01 mineralisation remains open in most directions, presenting a significant potential. maiden resource opportunity. ",

Skarn Deposits Skarn mineralogy is mappable in the field and serves as the broader \"alteration envelope\" around potential ore bodies. Most skarn deposits are predictably zoned in both mineralogy and geochemistry (Figure 2), and recognition of distal alteration features is important in the early exploration stages. Details of skarn mineralogy and zonation can be used to construct deposit-specific exploration models for developing exploration programs or regional syntheses. Copper skarns are considered the world's most abundant skarn type. They are common in orogenic zones related to subduction, both in oceanic and continental settings, and are generally associated with I-type (magnetite series calc-alkaline) porphyritic plutons with associated volcanic rocks. They have stockwork veins, brittle fractures and brecciation, and intense hydrothermal alteration. These features are indicative of a relatively shallow environment formation. Most copper skarns form close to intrusive stock contacts with a relatively oxidised skarn mineralogy. dominated by magnetite and garnet. ASX:QML ",

This includes ventilation, dewatering and electrical. infrastructure. Additional capital ($7o,oo0) was also included to provide for the installation of additional ground support around the underground portal location. The likely short duration of the project suggests that some of the items designated as capital would likely be addressed either through hire / rental agreements or included in the scope of supply for a mining contractor. For the purposes of this investigation, however, they have been treated as capital costs for the owner. Cut-off Grade Calculation A treatment plant breakeven cut-off grade was calculated to demonstrate a theoretical break-even point within. the resources. A theoretical, calculated cut-off was determined by: Total Ore Costs Where: Total Ore Costs - Processing and all ore related costs ($/t) Metal Price Gold price ($/g)  Royalty = State Royalty plus land title royalty (%) Recovery = Metallurgical Recovery (%) Three cut-off grades were calculated, reflecting the three cost increments noted in Table 8-1. These increments. represent: Total cut-off - accounts for all operating, processing and general and administrative (G&A) costs. Stoping cut-off -- considers only costs associated with stoping, process and G&A costs.. Transport and processing cut-off -- provides an incremental cut-off grade where material is incidentally mined in the process of accessing another mining block. This is also considered as the development cut-off grade. The resultant cut-off grades are provided in Table 5-5.

Sedimentary-Hosted Copper The Coppermine Project hosts the required first-order controls to harbour a sedimentary-hosted. copper deposit. Table 1 below outlines the required controls for the formation of such a deposit and. the features within the Coppermine Project matching these criteria. This mineralisation style has been. derisked by drilling results of Kaizen Discovery in 2015, where drillhole CP15 DD009 intersected 28.97m of 0.57% Cu from 197.03m within the basal Rae Group sediments, above the unconformable contact with the Coppermine River Group basalts Kaizen Discovery Inc. - News Releases - Kaizen Discovery announces drilling results from 2015 exploration<br>program at the Coppermine Project in Nunavut, Canada. Kaizen was conducting drill testing on widely spaced holes progressing west towards the mineral claims now held by the Company. Drillhole CP15_DD008 intersected a broad zone of highly anomalous zinc mineralisation, which with movement west to DDo09 evolved to copper. This indicates a zonation from distal to proximal environments within the mineralising system to the west, where the Company's mineral claims cover over 48 km strike length of the basal Rae Group sediments. Follow up drilling planned for 2016 by Kaizen Discovery was never completed, however 8 of 11 planned drillholes are now located in the Company's mineral claims.

The central area of the Mendooran project extends to the eastern boundary of the.

The occurrence of underlying mafic units suggests an oceanic origin. Multiple stages of deformation and metamorphism starting in the Late Ordovician (~450 Ma) led to the contraction and amalgamation of the Lachlan Orogen, which evolved from an oceanic turbidite fan system into continental crustal until the early Carboniferous (~380 Ma) (Foster and Gray, 2000).. The structural corridor formed at the Lachlan Transverse Zone (Figure 3.2) played a crucial role in. the emplacement of porphyry intrusive bodies with monzodioritic-dioritic to monzonite-granodiorite. compositions into the volcaniclastic and volcanic sequences. The northwestern tenements are. mainly covered by the Cenozoic Sedimentary Province consisting of mixed colluvial, alluvial and aeolian deposits, while Quaternary residual deposits and sandstones-siltstone sequences from the Great Australian Basin predominate in the southeastern tenements (Department of Regional New South Wales, 2008). The Lachlan Orogen is also marked by a long history of mineral production, with gold and copper deposits mainly hosted in porphyries in the Macquarie Arc.

Highlights AKORA reports an increase from 5.54 to 7.88 million tonnes of Indicated and Inferred DSO Resource at a grade of 58.8% Fe at its Bekisopa Iron Ore Project. This increases the Bekisopa Scoping Study' mine life to six years with JORC compliant resources expected to provide a significant uplift to the Scoping Study financials.  The Central and Northern zones at Bekisopa will provide future operating flexibility for DSO grade control. The Bekisopa DsO zones remain open for further infill drilling in multiple areas. AKORA Resources (ASX: AKO) (\"AKORA\" or \"Company\") has increased the JORC compliant indicated and inferred Direct Shipping Ore (DsO) resource at its flagship Bekisopa Iron Ore Project in Madagascar by 42% to 7.88 million tonnes (Mt) at an average grade of 58.8% Fe. The resource extension follows a DsO targeted shallow infill drilling program completed at Bekisopa in October 2023 and includes maiden resources from the project's Northern and Central zones as well as a small uplift in DsO inferred tonnage in the Southern zone. Bekisopa's Dso Resource formed the basis for the updated Scoping Study released in November 20231 which found that production could potentially ramp up to 2 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) 61% Fe average grade lump and fines product for use by Blast Furnace-Basic Oxygen Furnace (BFBOF) steelmakers and return strong cash flows and operating cost margin. AKORA Managing Director and CEO, Mr Paul Bibby said \"the increase in shallow DSO tonnage at the Bekisopa Project is expected to increase the Stage One mine life of our planned at-surface DSO mine to six years and dramatically improve project economics. Additionally, the strike length of mineralisation at Bekisopa has increased to 7km from 6km as we open up Bekisopa's northern zone. Notably, this upgraded DsO resource, which will be included in Bekisopa's Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) currently in progress, is only drawn from around half of this 7km strike length.' \"Moreover, the PFS does not include any upside potential DSO tonnes from the Company's nearby Satrokala Project where a 10km magnetic anomaly has been identified, nor does the PFS consider the potential for a larger longer mine life Stage Two where a high-grade +67% Fe concentrate could Satrokala, both 100% Akora owned, would significantly add to our initial DsO Start-Up Plan and result in significantly improved Study outcomes.\".

Drilling was conducted in the prominent southern zone (location of the 2023 JORC resource) and also targeted the central and northern areas of the deposit, adjacent to earlier resource definition drilling. The drill holes were shallow, targeting the highly weathered DSO zone and typically less than 30m in depth and typically using a 50m-by- 50m spacing pattern to support a high level of geological confidence. DSO intercepts averaged 56.7% Fe in the northern zone, 52.6% Fe in the central zone and 59.8% Fe in the southern zone. The drill hole information was provided to AKORA's engineer Wardell Armstrong International (WAl) to complete the Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE). A 3D block model was developed with. wireframe analysis then being used to further define the mineral resources areas. Mineralised areas were based on a nominal cut-off grade of 58% Fe for DsO in the southern and northern. zones, and 50% DsO for the central zone. Cut off grade analysis was reviewed using histogram and log probability plots and contiguous length analysis to determine a 'natural' cut off grade to define the mineralised zone. Iron mineralisation in the northern zone is interpreted over a strike length of 700m, with widths of between 30 and 100m. DSO thickness varies from 0.5m to 7.5m in thickness. Exploration remains open to the north and south. Figure 2 shows the location of the 15 northern zone 2023 drill holes which were either just one, two or three drill holes across the area of interest. A consequence of the limited number of drill holes per line is it reduces the confidence in the. continuity of the iron mineralisation and therefore the likelihood of the MRE being categorised in. the Indicated category. 2 Refer ASX Announcement 11 October 2023. 2 ",

The diamond drill rig will then be utilised to test targets generated from the 20,oo0m aircore drill program in progress at Aileron. A total of 70 aircore holes (~6,400m) have been completed to date and the first batch of priority. aircore samples from Crean has left site for analysis. Encounter Resources Ltd (\"Encounter') is pleased to announce that diamond drilling has commenced at the Aileron project (100% ENR) in the West Arunta region of WA.. Commenting on the diamond drilling campaign, Managing Director Will Robinson said:. \"The project wide Falcon gravity survey that we completed provided fundamental new data to target. IOCG and carbonatite-hosted niobium-REE deposits in the West Arunta region.. The survey defined key regional structures that transect the West Arunta including the NNE trending. Weddell Fault that bounds a number of the high priority prospects in the region. It highlighted significant gravity anomalies in the eastern part of Aileron including the discrete, high amplitude density anomaly at Perce, which is the first target to be tested.

Fifteen drill holes will test a series of targets along the Rhea Shear Zone thrust-faulted ironstone The Rhea Shear Zone is prospective for magnetite-shear zone-hosted Cu-Au mineralisation like the nearby mined E1 deposit and for Mt Dore style Cu-Au-Zn-Pb. GBM Resources Limited (ASX:GBZ) (GBM or the Company) is pleased to announce that a reverse circulation (RC) drilling program has now commenced at the Mount Margaret project, located near the Ernest Henry mine north of Cloncurry, Northwest Queensland. The Cloncurry Project is subject to a Farm- In/Joint Venture agreement with Nippon Mining of Australia (NMA, a wholly owned subsidiary of JX Advanced Metals Corporation (JXm)). Cloncurry Project exploration is fully funded by NMA who are currently entitled to a 56% interest in the Joint Venture. The 15 hole program is designed to test a suite of targets located under thin sedimentary cover along the same magnetic belt of Fort Constantine Volcanics that hosts Ernest Henry approximately 5 km to the south. During the 2023 field season, GBM drilled a single diamond hole (MMA016) testing an EM plate anomaly associated with the magnetic belt. This hole intercepted a broad interval of intensely sheared 228 m with anomalous Cu and Pb (Refer ASX:GBZ release 26 July 2023). Following this encouraging result, a new interpretation by GBM of the old MIM/Xstrata Rhea Shear Zone (RSZ) defined at least 12 km of strike length of this 100+ m wide 'ironstone' thrust fault within the JV holding (Figures 1 & 2). Analysis of earlier drilling completed by GBM and by prior explorers confirmed the association between the sheared magnetic belt and anomalous sulphide mineralisation. GBM's hole MMA001 for example, drilled in 2012 on the margin of the RSZ, intersected intense shearing fabric with pyrite and chalcopyrite throughout to over 600 m depth with a best result of 12 m @ 0.26 % Cu from 598 m (Refer ASX:GBZ release 31 January 2013 *). Soon after the discovery of EHM, WMC drilled FTCD1080 into the central zone of the RSZ where repeat thrusts form a stacked thrust block. This hole intersected \"visible supergene Cu mineralisation from 80 -120 m down hole in the form of filament Cu seams, native Cu nuggets and minor bornite\" (Mason 1995). Recent inspection of core from FTCD1080 by GBM geologists confirmed the presence of trace supergene Cu mineralisation *. Follow-up RC drilling by WMC intersected further visible supergene Cu nearby however did not locate their interpreted hypogene source (Mason 1995). ",

I would like to formally welcome you all to the 2024 Highfield Resources Annual General Meeting.. This year has been a significant one for Highfield, with substantial progress made on our flagship Muga Potash Mine project and changes to our Board of Directors. In addition to the amazing effort of securing all the key Muga Project permits in 2023, the Company updated the Muga feasibility study, reconfirming the outstanding project metrics over a 30-year Life of Mine. The. Project economics are robust, with an NPV8 of 1.82 billion and a 24% IRR (post-tax). The EBITDA is projected to be 340 million per annum in full production. The pre-production capital requirement for Phase 1 is 449 million. We are strategically located in the middle of the western European market, with excellent access to ports, transport, and renewable grid power. Our mine access is straightforward with shallow mineralization and low. technical risk with conventional mining and processing methods.. We continue to work diligently to secure the remaining financing required for phase 1 operations. We are in negotiations with a range of parties encompassing strategic partnerships, non-dilutive royalties, equity, and. offtake agreements. We have been frustrated with the time taken to finalise these negotiations and will update the market as appropriate. We are delighted to have signed a binding offtake agreement with Maxisalt, a global Spanish chemical and salt producer and trader, to supply 75,000tpa of by-product salt. We welcomed Mr. Luke Anderson to the Board this year.A qualified chartered accountant, Mr.Anderson brings over 25 years of experience in executive management, corporate development, corporate treasury, financial management, and financial services roles in major international resource and transport companies across Australia and the United States. We also mourn the loss of our esteemed Board member, Mr. Brian Jamieson. His wisdom, passion, and intellect will be greatly missed. With the recent signing of our key Construction contract with EPOs-Tunelan construction start of the declines and underground facilities is planned to start in 2024. We are very excited about the start of construction and look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. I would like to also take the opportunity to thank my fellow Board members, the management team led by Ignacio Salazar, and our dedicated employees for all their efforts over the year.I would very much like to thank all our shareholders for their loyalty and continued support over this past challenging year. We are now at the junction of a very exciting stage in Highfields's development, and I look forward to Highfield continuing its positive trajectory towards becoming a successful and sustainable long-life producer of potash.

Exploration licence E5i/i217, which surrounds the current Andy Well Mining Lease M51/870 was pegged by joint venture parties Accent Resources NL (85%) and Murchison Resources Pty Ltd (15%) in February 2007 and granted during January 2008. E51/1217 was pegged to cover the area of a previous tenement, E51/290, which formed the basis of a joint venture between Accent Resources NL and Australasian Gold Mines NL. A subsequent change in strategy by Accent Resources NL in 20o8 dissolved the joint venture, with 100% of E51/1217 reverting to Murchison Resources Pty Ltd. On 12 November 2oo9, Doray Minerals Limited (Doray) signed a purchase/joint venture Ltd. The agreement allowed Doray to purchase the remaining 20%, which subsequently occurred in 20i2, consolidating a 100% interest in the Project. Murchison Resources Pty Ltd retained a 1% NSR royalty (Wilson Royalty) over E51/1217. A portion of E51/1217 covering the Andy Well Mine was converted to Mining License M51/870 in April 2012 and Doray commenced production in September 2012. In 2019, Silver Lake merged with Doray. In February 2021, Silver Lake sold E51/1217, M51/870 and the adjacent Gnaweeda tenure to Meeka Metals.. 2.1.2Exploration including Dominion Mining Limited and Western Mining Corporation Limited. These. programs included detailed 5Om line spaced aeromagnetic surveys; geological and regolith mapping; lag and soil sampling and reverse circulation (Rc), aircore (AC) and limited diamond drilling. This work resulted in the identification of sporadic. mineralisation at several prospects.. Australasian Gold Mines NL and Accent Resources NL drilled 28 holes in the 2oo0s before abandoning the program due to bad weather and inconsistent results. Work to this date was based on an interpreted northerly strike of the mineralised structures.. Doray commenced exploration in March 2oi0 with an RC program designed to test the interpretation of previous explorers' results. This led to a revised north-easterly striking. interpretation for the mineralisation and the program was successful in intersecting high- grade quartz hosted gold mineralisation within mafic rocks, the Wilber lode. Follow-up RC and diamond drilling successfully intersected mineralisation over a strike length of approximately 200 m below 4-8 m of alluvial cover. By the end of 201l, Doray had drilled out a high-grade Mineral Resource of 329,o00oz @ 14.8g/t Au and planning advanced on both mine and mill construction. During 2012 and 2013 additional parallel lodes were discovered at Judy, Judy North and Suzie, resulting in further Mineral Resource growth to 44l,oo0oz @ 1l.2g/t Au. By September 2oi7, when the mine was placed on care and maintenance, drilling had defined a Mineral Resource of 505,oo0oz @ 8.6g/t Au after accounting for mining depletion. 2.1.3Production History. A 165Ktpa mill, which ultimately proved capable of processing 35oKtpa, was constructed. 31 ",

Gold grades within veining. are in general above 30g/t, whilst grades outside of veining but within the mineralised. envelope are in the order of <0.3g/t Au.. Mineralised veins are interpreted petrographically as a space-filling. During flow of the hydrothermal fluid through the open structure, slivers of altered wall were scavenged into the structure, and suffered replacement to form fine-grained fuchsite + chlorite in. quartz, forming finer-grained sutured mosaics.. Historical production was principally sourced from the Wilber lode, a sub-vertical slightly boudinage texture. The lode forms an extensive and largely continuous sheet of mineralisation, which is currently defined over 60om strike and 700m down dip remaining open at depth.. 38 ",

Lithologies at Turnberry are dominated by dolerites with the best section of mineralisation hosted within a magnetic quartz dolerite which forms a discrete 'double bullseye' aeromagnetic anomaly. The magnetic dolerite is likely to represent a fractionated portion of a layered dolerite sill with a contribution of magnetite from grades and widths..

Folds are interpreted. to plunge steeply north in the northern part of Turnberry and more sub-vertical in the southern part. Several northwest-southeast structures are interpreted from geophysical imagery to crosscut the stratigraphy and appear to offset both lithology and. mineralisation. The structural data (e.g. foliation, veins, fractures, joints, crenulation) from drill core at Turnberry are indicative of high-strain deformation within a steeply east-southeast dipping shear zone. The alignment of discontinuous and boudinaged veins subparallel to the measured foliation, as well as the precipitation of quartz in fold hinges, suggest that gold mineralisation typically occurs in dilational sites during fault slip, whereas the shear zone may have acted as fluid pathway. Folding of lithological units, especially at the contacts to other units, may have provided space for Au mineralisation to be deposited. as saddle reefs within the hinges of these folds. In fact, some of the highest Au grades have been reported in the hinges of folded lithological contacts or along fold limbs. Mineralisation forms a 1.7km north-northeast trending gold anomalous corridor, which is. broadly defined into three zones, Turnberry South, Central and North. Mineralisation is primarily hosted where shears intersect fold hinges (saddles) and limbs of felsic Iithological boundaries. Vein and shear-hosted mineralisation are also present at the mafic contact, which tends to host narrow, high-grade gold. In other areas (e.g. outside of fold hinges or lithological contacts), gold mineralisation is controlled by the orientation of. steeply, dipping veins within the shear zone. 40 ",

All process water requirements will come from ongoing dewatering of underground and open pit mines. 7.1Andy Well. horizons have been identified below the saprolite, which extends to a depth of 1Ombgl The aquifers are not continuous, and some degree of compartmentalisation is expected. The most significant permeabilities are associated with the ore body transition zone aquifers. Some minor groundwater inflows may also be derived from the country rock transition zone aquifers and deeper ore body aquifer. Some anisotropy or preferred. groundwater flow is likely parallel to the strike of the ore body and major structural features. Historical dewatering records indicate mine groundwater inflows of 15 to 20L/s resulting in a positive water balance. Surface discharge is planned to occur at existing ridgeline discharge locations. Table 9 - Andy Well Aquifer Characteristics Zone Characteristicse From the base of saprolite to around 35 to 40mbgl (445 to 440mAHD) is a highly weathered and fractured zone. This zone is also highly oxidized with abundant iron staining on fracture surfaces. Near surface unloading and Upper Transition opening of fractures, enhanced by chemical weathering has resulted in a Zone Aquifer transition zone aquifer with potential for moderate to high permeability. As the water table is around 5 to 6m below ground the majority of this material is saturated. Beneath the upper transition zone is a zone of partial oxidation and discrete Lower Transition fracturing, with the frequency of fracturing decreasing with depth. This zone generally extends to around 70 to 80m below ground (410 to 400mAHD). Zone Aquifer bulk permeability of this zone is likely to be moderate to low. Basement Aquifer permeability. Occasional discrete fractures and fracture zones are evident and may result in localised groundwater inflows. 7.2 Turnberry / St Anne's Groundwater occurrence in the area can be categorised into three aquifer types; surficial, sedimentary and fractured rock. Locally, most domestic and stock water requirements are met from small supplies of fresh to brackish groundwater sourced from surficial aquifers (hosted in colluvium, valley-fill alluvium, and calcrete). Away from the drainage lines, low yielding supplies can be sourced from colluvial hillslope wash, weathered. fractured rock aquifers are variable and water quality is mostly related to geology. Groundwater occurrence within the weathering profile, fractures in the bedrock and groundwater encountered during drilling at Turnberry. Groundwater flow is interpreted to be structurally controlled and the geology is anisotropic, with apparent increased hydraulic conductivity in a northwest-southeast orientation.

Strong relationships with our key external stakeholders for this project are vital for a smooth and expedient development process. To this end, I would like to thank the Corker family at Red Hill station for the collaborative and cooperative approach they have adopted in their dealings with us. Being able to quickly agree our access arrangement with Red Hill Station enabled our field team to complete the rock chip campaign and preparations for our June drilling program well ahead of time.. I also extend my appreciation to the MinRes team at the Ken's Bore Project for their ongoing assistance in facilitating the safe and expeditious passage of our exploration and drilling teams through their project areas. Next week, we will undertake an archaeological and anthropological survey at Cane Bore in accordance with the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972. This survey will facilitate the clearing of areas for infrastructure that will support exploration, additional access tracks as well as the drill pads for the 50m x 50m spaced drill programs at both the Europa and Callisto Prospects. Now that our Program of Works has been approved, completing this heritage survey is the last item required for us to be fully permitted for the RC drilling commencing in June 2024. Looking forward, I am pleased that we have locked in flora and fauna surveys for early spring as these reports will enable us to prepare submissions for the environmental approvals required for us to begin construction activities and, subsequently, mining and processing operations at Cane Bore.

Funding options include conventional equity, debt and grant funding, as well as  joint venture partnerships The proposed expansion mining developments are to occur several years after production is planned to have commenced at the Vittangi Anode Project (ASX:TLG 1 July 2021) where revenue from steady state production is expected to provide part of the funding solution for any expansion development. The ultimate funding strategy will be based on the negotiations with potential partners and financiers, a final investment decision. Whilst pursuing funding initiatives, Talga will look to optimise and reduce the estimated capital and operating costs during future study phases. Based on the above, the Company has formed the view that there are reasonable grounds to assume the likelihood of successfully raising finance, sufficient to cover the estimated capital and working capital costs for the mining development as and when required. Scoping Study Completion Completion of the expanded anode production Scoping Study is expected in Q4 2024 following completion of downstream anode refinery expansion studies.

        "text": "Some amphibolite rocks within the shear zones have been altered to biotite schist and the gold bearing quartz veins within the shear zones are weakly sulphidic. Gold was said to be associated with pyrite-arsenopyrite and/or chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite mineralisation. Mine workings on the Main Lode comprise an open pit to a depth of about 20m and underground drives and stopes down to the 4th Level at 90m depth. Some stopes were up to 10m wide but were generally between 2m and 5m wide. The lode strikes N-S over most of its length and dips steeply to the east. It was mined over a strike length of about 2oom. Mine records show that within the broader lode, a small high-grade shoot which plunges to the south at 40 to 50 degrees is coincident with thickened parasitic fold on the east limb. The Main Lode was best developed between 15 and 60m vertical depth (Levels 1 and 3) and widest at. approximately 30m vertical depth (Level 2). The East Lode was discovered following underground drilling from the Main Lode workings, and subsequently developed over six levels to a total vertical depth of approximately 155m. Stopes were from 2 to 1Om wide and generally around 5m wide. The lode strikes NNE and dips steeply to the west. The best mineralisation is developed around a parasitic fold on the eastern limb of a north-plunging synform, and close to the closure of this structure (Figure 3). The lode was mined to surface in a steeply north-plunging shoot but in the deeper levels the plunge flattens markedly as it tracks northward along the closure of the synform. At the cessation of mining on the 6th Level the shoot was becoming sub-horizontal.. West Lode and New Lode are linked by development from the Mt Palmer shaft at the 2nd Level. The New Lode consists of two lodes approximately 1Om apart, which have been interpreted to form an anticlinal fold closure close to the present-day land surface. The fold is interpreted to plunge to the north. The New Lode has been mined over a strike length of 50m to a depth of 30m. The stopes are 2-3m wide and open to the surface. The lodes strike NNE and NE and both dip steeply to the east. The open pit is inaccessible due to steep walls and unstable ground and the stopes below the pit floor are filled with water. The West Lode was mined over a strike length of about 40m to a depth of 30m. The reported stopes are about 2m wide but do not reach the surface as the lode is reported to have pinched out 5m below surface. The lode strikes N-S but swings to the SW at its southern end and dips steeply to the east. Historical exploration programmes at Mt Palmer Gold Mine were focused on gold mineralisation. The drilling database notes numerous parallel pegmatite intersections of up to 5Om thickness that have never been assayed for lithium.. 5 ",

In this time, our focus has been on hiring local people with varying degrees of. mining experience, including those new to the industry. This approach has allowed Kingston to develop and train a dedicated team for the tailings project who are now transitioning to the open pit mining team. A passionate, supportive and highly effective Kingston work culture has emerged.. The low-cost refurbishment of the plant will provide Kingston with a versatile operating polymetallic processing facility, capable of processing all configurations of oxide and sulphide Cobar style mineralisation, containing precious and base metal-- Cu, Au, Zn, Pb & Ag. The existing CIL on site can maintain a throughput of 100tph,. with the current grinding circuit capable of running at 5Otph. Mineral Hill offers a unique opportunity within the Cobar region as it is a fully approved operating mine with a cash backed environmental bond, and a highly supportive community.. Hill. The open pit production will significantly increase cashflow to expand the business. Kingston's aim is to establish a long-life precious and base metal mine with both organic and inorganic expansion options.\".

VALLEY BORE IRON ORE (AIchemy 50% / Carey Mining 50% Iron Ore rights) In May 2024, Alchemy geologists conducted a reconnaissance mapping and sampling trip to Valley Bore prospect. Twenty (20) rock-chip samples were collected from the banded iron formation (\"BIF\") outcrops within the Valley Bore prospect. on M52/844-I. This area is dominated by two distinct northeast trending ridges comprised of BIF, banded chert, siltstone, haematitic shales, and massive hematite lenses (Figure 3). Alchemy retains the rights to 1o0% of the mineral rights for all Mining 50%), with Alchemy having a Right of First Refusal over Carey Mining's interest. Northern Ridge Target: The northern ridge in the Valley Bore area is characterised by numerous banded iron and banded chert formations which outcrop for approximately 1.5km along strike. Hematite and goethite rich units of BIF are observed. These lenses are between 5 and 15 metres thick and are interpreted to extend along strike to the southwest, with historic sampling of hematite outcrop returning grades up to 61.91% Fe (Figure 4). Southern Ridge Target: The southern ridge of the Valley Bore area is dominated by laterally extensive hematite units, several BIFs and banded chert units (Figures 4). The massive hematite unit can be followed along strike for over 800 metres in strike and ranges from 10m to 100m wide (Figure 4). High grade rock-chip assays were received, including up to 65.3% Fe in sample VB005. This unit is interpreted to continue along strike with recent mapping confirming hematite outcrop assays up to 60.2% Fe in sample VB001, approximately 750m to the southwest of Southern Ridge Target (Figure 4). Old Highway Target:. The Old Highway target lies in the south-east corner of tenement E52/4090 (Figure 3). The area is dominated by a long, northeast trending ridge consisting of inter-bedded siltstone, banded chert, and minor BiFs.Iron enrichment and hematite lenses are observed within the BIFs and on the eastern end of the ridge. High grade iron ore enrichment is related to hematite within a fold hinge on the eastern side of the prospect. Previous sampling returned grades within the high-grade hematite zone up to 64.09% Fe (Figure 6). Alchemy Resources Limited -- ASX Announcement. Page | 3 ",

Resources Pty Ltd (15%) in February 2007 and granted during January 2008. E51/1217 was pegged to cover the area of a previous tenement, E51/290, which formed the basis of a joint venture between Accent Resources NL and Australasian Gold Mines NL. A subsequent change in strategy by Accent Resources NL in 2oo8 dissolved the joint venture, with 100% of E51/1217 reverting to Murchison Resources Pty Ltd. On 12 November 2oo9, Doray Minerals Limited (Doray) signed a purchase/joint venture Ltd. The agreement allowed Doray to purchase the remaining 2o%, which subsequently the Andy Well Mine was converted to Mining License M51/870 in April 2012 and Doray. commenced production in September 2012. In 2019, Silver Lake merged with Doray. In February 2021, Silver Lake sold E51/1217, M51/870 and the adjacent Gnaweeda tenure to Meeka Metals.. 2.1.2Exploration including Dominion Mining Limited and Western Mining Corporation Limited. These programs included detailed 5Om line spaced aeromagnetic surveys; geological and regolith mapping; lag and soil sampling and reverse circulation (RC), aircore (AC) and limited diamond drilling. This work resulted in the identification of sporadic. mineralisation at several prospects. Australasian Gold Mines NL and Accent Resources NL drilled 28 holes in the 2oo0s before abandoning the program due to bad weather and inconsistent results. Work to this date was based on an interpreted northerly strike of the mineralised structures.. Doray commenced exploration in March 20i0 with an RC program designed to test the interpretation of previous explorers' results. This led to a revised north-easterly striking. grade quartz hosted gold mineralisation within mafic rocks, the Wilber lode. Follow-up RC and diamond drilling successfully intersected mineralisation over a strike length of approximately 200 m below 4-8 m of alluvial cover. By the end of 20ll, Doray had drilled out a high-grade Mineral Resource of 329,o00oz @ 14.8g/t Au and planning advanced on both mine and mill construction. During 2012 and 2013 additional parallel lodes were discovered at Judy, Judy North and Suzie, resulting in further Mineral Resource growth to 44l,oo0oz @ 1l.2g/t Au. By September 2oi7, when the mine was placed on care and maintenance, drilling had defined a Mineral Resource of 505,000oz @ 8.6g/t Au after accounting for mining depletion. 2.1.3Production History.

The Gnaweeda tenure in its current form was then pegged by Helix Resources NL (Helix) and JA Bunting and Associates (JA Bunting) in 20ol, and subsequently experienced fragmented ownership over the proceeding decade. Helix assigned their interest to JA Bunting and Associates in 2004 prior to JA Bunting selling to Bullion Minerals Limited (Bullion) in July 2004. JA Bunting retained a 1% NSR royalty over the tenure. In January 2o06, Teck Australia Pty Ltd (Teck) entered into a earn-in agreement to acquire up to 7o% interest in the Gnaweeda tenements from Bullion by meeting expenditure commitments. In March 2006, Bullion vended its gold assets (30% Gnaweeda interest included) into a new ASx listing, Chalice Gold Mines Limited (Chalice). Star) entered into an option agreement with Teck to acquire Teck's interest in Gnaweeda by meeting exploration expenditure hurdles. Teck retained an earn back option in the event that Archean Star defined a Mineral Resource of at least 1,ooo,ooo ounces of gold. If exercised, the Teck option allowed Teck to earn back 75% of the interest assigned to proportional interest in the Project, at the time 51% but up to 70% if all the expenditure hurdles were to be met.. By January 2oio, Teck had satisfied the requirements to acquire 70% interest in Gnaweeda and Archean Star was working toward exercising its option to acquire Teck's Between 20i0 and February 2013, Chalice's interest in the Gnaweeda tenure was diluted down to 12%.

Licences and 48 Exploration Licence Applications within the province. Exploration done The West Arunta Project has had limited historic work completed by other parties within the Project area, with the broader area having exploration focused on gold, base metals, diamonds and potash. Significant previous explorers of the Project area include Beadell Resources and Meteoric Resources. Only one drill hole (RDDol) had been completed within the tenement area by Meteoric in 2009 (located approximately 17km southwest of the Luni deposit), and more recently additional drilling nearby the Project has been completed by Encounter Resources Ltd. Most of the historic work was focused on the Urmia and Sambhar Prospects with historic exploration (other than RDDo1) being limited. to geophysical surveys and surface sampling. Historical exploration reports are referenced within the WA1 Resources Ltd Prospectus dated 29 November 2021 which was released by ASX on 4 February 2022. Encounter Resources are actively exploring on neighbouring tenements and have reported intersecting similar geology, including carbonatite rocks. Geology The West Arunta Project is located within the West Arunta Orogen, representing the western-most part of the Arunta Orogen which straddles the Western Australia-Northern Territory border. Outcrop in the area is generally poor, with bedrock largely covered by Tertiary sand dunes and spinifex country of the Gibson Desert. As. a result, geological studies in the area have been limited, and a broader understanding of the geological setting is interpreted from early mapping as presented on the MacDonald (Wells, 1968) and Webb (Blake, 1977 (First Edition) and Spaggiari et al., 2016 (Second Edition)) 1:250k scale geological map sheets. The West Arunta Orogen is considered to be the portion of the Arunta Orogen commencing at, and west of, the Western Australia- Northern Territory border.

HIGHLIGHTS : 2,067m, ninety-five (95) hole, aircore drilling program completed at Capel Mineral Sands Project .Drilling program completed within six days and ahead of schedule. . Samples to be brought back to Perth for assay at Diamantina Laboratories. . Previous exploration1 on the project conducted by lluka Resources (Asx: ILu) identified shallow. heavy mineral sands (HMs) mineralisation including: O  21m at 3.3% HMS from surface (RB007) 21m at 2.6% HMs from surface (RB001) o18m at 2.2% HMS from surface (RB003) The south west of Western Australia is a well-known HMS region with a number of large deposits currently being mined by global companies including Tronox (NYsE: TRox), Iluka (AsX: ILU) and. Doral (Iwatani Corp - TYO:8088) Pinnacle Minerals Ltd (Pim:Asx) (\"Pinnacle\", the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that a 2,067m, ninety-five-hole aircore drilling program has been. completed by Wallis Drilling at the Capel Mineral Sands Project (\"Project\"). The campaign encountered coherent mineralisation and was completed ahead of schedule, within six (6) days. Samples are in transit to Diamantina Laboratories in Malaga where they will be subjected to a heavy liquid separation analysis to determine sample composition and total heavy mineral (THM) content. Scanning of the HM sink by Diamantina mineralogist will  inform on the valuable heavy mineral fraction (VHM%). and the mineral assemblage, to guide further studies on. the project. It is expected that the results from the assays could take between 6-8 weeks to be returned in full, at which time the company will update the market.. Figure 1: Final hole of the campaign. Pinnacle Minerals Managing Director, Nic Matich, commented:. \"Completing the first drilling program of 2024 on schedule is a testament to the team's resolve. assay results are eagerly anticipated given some of the visual estimates panned during the. program.\" Pinnacle Minerals Ltd Issued Capital Australian Registered Office.

Techniques supplied with a series of pulverised RC assay pulp samples and as-received, non- pulverised, RC chip samples (Phase 1 and Phase 2) and diamond core (Phase 2) from the 2023 program and tasked with assessing the leach response with variations in temperature, acid type and pH, residence time and grind size for the fresh and oxidised granite Wide spaced, reverse circulation percussion (RC) holes were drilled to test the extent of shallow rare earth mineralisation in granite to about 100m below surface and provide samples for proof-of-concept leach test work designed to seek an effective process for REO extraction (refer Red Metal ASX announcement. dated 21 August 2023). A total of 19 wide spaced RC holes were drilled to assess REO grade and mineralogical variation across the granite, and discovered. shallow, large widths of granite-hosted REO mineralisation at relatively high grades, with three broad areas of interest identified - Boundary Fence East, Boundary Fence West, and Donkey Dam (Figures 9 and 10). The Phase 2 leach test work, follows on from the Phase 1 proof of concept research on non-pulverised, RC chip samples from the Boundary Fence East area. that demonstrated high rare earth extractions (averaging 78% neodymium, 79% praseodymium, 48% terbium and 44% dysprosium) can be achieved using pH 1 intermittent bottle roll tests (1BRT) at ambient temperature (refer Red Metal ASX announcement dated 1 February 2024 and 18 March 2024). HQ and PQ diamond core holes were drilled from surface through the weathered. granite into fresh granite at two separate locations to acquire core for Phase 2. Teach tests and comminution studies. One hole was completed at Boundary Fence West (SBDDo01) adjacent to percussion hole SBRcO08. Three separate twinned holes were completed at Boundary Fence East (SBDDO02, SBDD003, SBDD004) adjacent to percussion hole SBRc016. Refer Figure 9, Appendix 2. The drill depths and mass recoveries are visually represented below.. SBDD001 SBDD002 SBDDOO3 SBDD004 The IBRT in Phase 2 utilised representative diamond drill core from SBDD002 (Boundary Fence East , Figure 9, Appendix 1) for the partly weathered and fresh rock where core recovery was good (15-60 metres). While non-pulverised RC. chips from the nearby percussion hole SBRc016 were sampled for weathered rock (0-15 metres) where drill core recovery in SBDDo02 was very low. and not representative due to a loss of REO-enriched fines into the drill sump.. Sample loss as a result of drill-bit flushing appears to have resulted in a grade. bias due to loss of fines, evident when comparing the SBDD002-004 head grade. with the previous RC drill grades from sBrc016.

(GR24RC001 - GR24RC019) with five of these holes drilled at the Peveril prospect. The RC drilling. was designed to test for extensions and continuity to outcropping copper mineralised structures based on a newly developed geological and mineralisation model (see ASx announcement 14 March 2024). The drilling successfully extended a high-grade plunging shoot beneath outcropping copper mineralisation at the Peveril prospect and confirmed the existence of a copper mineralised structure at the Central Gossan prospect along strike. The results of the drilling reinforce G11's interpretation that the copper mineralisation is structurally remobilised from a deeper volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) source..

Wilandra Central now has a 4.Okm strike extent of mineralised structure, which remains open in all directions. This includes higher grade shoots with immediate and substantial mineral resource potential. Significantly, we now have a proven exploration methodology with this round of drilling demonstrating the effectiveness of EM as a targeting tool. This exploration approach will be immediately rolled out to our Rainbow Tank, Basalt Ridge, Black Hills, Big Mother and Cymbric Vale targets..

Millennium drilling Initial scout drilling toward the Fountain Range-Quamby Fault Zone completed in 2022 was successful in defining anomalous Cu mineralisation3 in the footwall and to the north-west of the existing Millennium resource. However, the region further west towards the fault and the fault itself was not able to be tested due to access issues. Exposure in the Fault Zone area is very limited due to post-mineralisation cover by Quamby Conglomerate alluvials (Figure 3). A small drilling program is currently underway with an all-terrain drilling rig, with two holes planned to test the Fault Zone - one of which is directly under significant exposure of outcropping copper oxide in a polyphase siliceous fault breccia - plus a diamond core extension or 'tail' to an existing RC pre-collar hole from previous drilling in the Central Area of the existing resource. 3 MBK ASX Release 31 October 2022 \"Copper-cobalt grades continue at depth at Millennium\".

The Peregrine Gold Newman Gold Project tenement holding was established by a syndicate. led by Peregrine founding director George Merhi in 2020. The district scale tenement package was assembled after noting that \"epizonal' quartz textures were observed in the area by previous explorers as far back as the 1980's. Epizonal gold systems are known to. produce the highest-grade gold deposits currently known, including the exceptional Swan. Zone at the Fosterville Gold field.. On listing in 2021 and using geochemical reconnaissance sampling techniques honed from technical program rapidly discovered multiple outcrops with visible gold with some specimens grading multi % in gold and silver content. The grade and spectacular gold content vindicating the original rationale for exploring in this traditional iron ore area. Studies are ongoing into resolving the nature of gold mineralisation, with the CSIRO in WA confirming the gold in specimens is predominantly primary in nature. Following on an initial drilling programme in 2022 at a number of prospects, the Company made its first bedrock gold discovery at the Tin Can Prospect in 2023 with close spaced mineralisation. The Company is still at the very early stages of exploring in this area with new prospects continually being discovered and evaluated over the extensive Newman land package and is. confident the area will develop into Australia's next great gold camp.

Negligible sample loss has been recorded. recovery  DD was undertaken and the core measured and orientated to determine recovery, which was generally 100% in transitional / fresh rock.  RC samples were visually checked for recovery, moisture and contamination. A cyclone and cone splitter were used to provide a uniform sample, and these were routinely cleaned.  RC Sample recoveries are generally high. No significant sample loss has been recorded. RC chips are logged to geological boundaries, with chip trays photographed and stored for future reference.

Dalgaranga produced over 70,o00oz of gold in Fy2022 before being placed on care and maintenance in November 2022 to implement an operational reset designed to preserve the value of its extensive infrastructure and Resource base while developing a new, sustainable operating plan.. This approach is underpinned by the exceptional high-grade Never Never gold discovery, which was made in Dalgaranga. The Company has moved to rapidly unlock the potential of this significant discovery, which comprises a current JORc Mineral Resource of 952,o00oz at an average grade of 5.74g/t (read the announcement here). In February 2023, the Company announced an 18-month exploration and strategic plan (the \"365\" strategy) targeting: A +300koz Reserve at a grade exceeding 4.0g/t Au at Never Never;.  A +600koz Resource at a grade exceeding 5.0g/t Au at Never Never;.  The development of a 5-year mine plan aimed at delivering gold production of 130-150koz per annum. This strategy is centred around an aggressive exploration program at Never Never designed to target. Resource expansion, Reserve definition and near-mine exploration drilling targeting Never Never \"lookalikes' including Four Pillars, West Winds and Sly Fox.. surrounding exploration tenements and also owns the advanced 244koz Yalgoo Gold Project, where permitting activities are well advanced to establish a potential satellite mining operation at the Melville deposit. In addition to Dalgaranga and Yalgoo, the Company's 527koz advanced exploration and development project at Glenburgh-Mt Egerton, located ~3ookm north of Dalgaranga, has the potential to be a second production hub. Spartan is committed to safe and respectful operation as a professional and considerate organisation within a. each other and to our community, to respect the unique environment we operate within and to show respect. to all of our various stakeholders..

Cue sits on greenstone sequences transacted by the Cuddingwarra Shear to the west. Second order shearing (Lena Shear) is the dominant feature through the Project which hosts lower grade mineralisation. High grade mineralisation is generally hosted within brittle units between ductile lithologies. Then there are smaller resources. throughout Cue which are hosted in several lithologies including BIF and sheared, high-magnesium basalts. Mineralisation in the BOD and White Heat (WH) areas is found in the Starlight Basalt stratigraphic unit. The area Veining exists both parallel to, and oblique to the main shear zone, leading to the interpretation of a multi-stage development history, with a complex gold distribution. 3 ",

Loyal Lithium has Launched a comprehensive high resolution geophysical survey over a 75km? area of the Trieste Lithium Project, employing innovative sensors for in-depth analysis beyond 600 meters(1). The cutting-edge geophysical survey leverages natural electromagnetic fields to investigate and differentiate between highly resistive rock types (i.e. pegmatitic and. metamorphic), which have been indistinguishable with prior technologies.. The geophysical survey is also expected to reveal conductive and contrasting structural features within Trieste's unique 20km? Metasediment Fault Flow Zone, in which the six known prominent spodumene bearing pegmatite outcrops have been discovered.. Multi-sensor data analysis will create a detailed 3D model, identifying drilling targets to build upon recent drilling campaigns that intersected thick, shallow, high-grade spodumene pegmatites, including 31.8m of 2.2% LiO from 2.9m.  The $3.3M recently raised bolsters Loyal Lithium's existing $5.0m(2) in funding to enable this. lithium hub..  The Trieste Lithium Project is strategically located along the Trieste Greenstone Belt and connected to multiple spodumene-bearing lithium projects, including Rio Tinto/Midland Lithium Project with a JORC Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate of 78Mt at 1.15% LiO(3) Loyal Lithium Limited (Asx:Lli) (Loyal Lithium, LLI, or the Company) is excited to Iaunch an of investigation surpassing 6oo meters. Expert Geophysics Limited is conducting this survey, which includes 2,173km of flight lines, utilising groundbreaking sensors that exploit natural. electromagnetic fields. This advanced technology is a leap forward for hard rock lithium exploration, enabling the differentiation between highly resistive rock types such as pegmatitic and metamorphic, a capability not possible with previous technologies.

Classification Classification of the resource estimate has been guided by confidence in the geological interpretation and drill density. The Kurrajong Mineral Resource has been classified as Inferred.. The drill and input data density is reasonable in its coverage for this style of mineralisation and estimation techniques to allow confidence for the tonnage and grade distribution to the level of Inferred. The Kurrajong geology interpretation/model and resource estimate appropriately reflects the Competent Persons understanding of the geological and grade distributions at the Kurrajong Deposit.. The Inferred Mineral Resource is equivalent to an approximate drill spacing up to 80m x 80m. Audits or reviews External reviews and audits have not been conducted on the Kurrajong Mineral Resource estimate. The database was audited internally prior to the grade estimation.. 108 | Page ",

The project area captures over 270km? of fertile sequences of the Cobar Supergroup and growth faults between basement and basin infill sequences. The Achilles 1 Prospect lies at the southern end of a major shear zone that hosts the AGC Achilles 2 and 3 exploration conducted at Achilles 1 has been previously reported by SER3 and includes a grid-based soil sampling program by Santa Fe Mining (SFM) in 1996 and 1997 which defined strong copper (up to 169ppm) aae (addan aa) anuapaanno fqddan a) aann aaaann aan daaaannn (addaaan ao) aaae pan (addaaa aa) pnn) drill program surrounding the Achilles 1 soil sampling program which returned anomalous base metal values of up to 410ppm Cu, 2050ppm Pb and 818ppm Zn. A two-hole diamond drill program was completed by Western Plains Gold (WPG) in 2005, designed to test two of the soil anomalies identified by SFM. Hole DDH-A1-1 was abandoned due to caving at 184.1m, failing to reach its target depth of 250m. The hole intersected significant metamorphic recrystallisation and silicification related to shearing, but no evidence of base metal mineralisation. DDH-A1-2 was successfully completed to 300.4m and intersected a broad zone of intense hydrothermal alteration, with blebs of chalcopyrite and minor chalcocite. The hole returned a peak value of 0.33% Cu from 90m to 92m, within a 64m zone averaging 0.10% Cu, from 76m to 140m. HyLoggerTM hyperspectral logging of these two diamond holes by the GSNSW revealed mineralogical changes that are typical for Cobar-style Cu-Au mineral systems, including replacement of phengite by muscovite, replacement of Mg-chlorite by Fe-chlorite and destruction of potassium feldspar. These trends, coupled with the low-grade copper mineralisation in DDH-A1-2, suggest to SER that the two drillholes represent near misses. Exploration undertaken to advance the South Cobar Project by SER has included an airborne magnetic and. radiometric survey across the entire tenement with infill lines to 50m spacing across Achilles 1, and the. subsequent integration of the magnetic and radiometric data with previous exploration data, including the 2.5km line spaced AEM data collected by GSNSW and Geoscience Australia4. An Ultrafine+TM geochemical soil survey was completed over a 4km-by-4km area designed to provide more regional context to the previously closed-spaced soil sampling undertaken by Santa Fe Mining in 1996 and 1997. The survey returned strongly anomalous copper, lead and zinc, and elevated gold, molybdenum and arsenic results coincident with mapped ~N-S striking zones of strong silicification that is limited to the Achilles 1 Prospect3.

The geophysical attributes are similar to the Wallaby prospect but indicate a deeper target. Placer carried out ground magnetic traverses and modelled the magnetic feature with a target depth at over 400m depth. A single drill hole to 230m depth was designed to test if an alteration zone occurred peripheral to the magnetic feature, nearer to the surface above the target. Placer did not attempt to drill the magnetic target itself considering that it was too deep. The hole which was drilled on the northwest side of the anomaly was un-mineralised and no alteration was seen in the hole and as such the anomaly remains unexplained. Mt Carol Mine lies 2.75km to the southeast on the southern side of the magnetic anomaly. At the mine, a small mining operation has removed several hundred tonnes of copper carbonate ore from a narrow flat dipping shear/vein zone in micaceous schist. Extensive boudinage is obvious on the shear, pre- and post-mineralisation. The prospect is highlighted by highly anomalous copper in stream samples. Rock chip samples from the area have returned values up to 7.4% Cu and 0.85ppm Au (CsR) and 21.1% Cu and 3.9ppm Au (CEC), however no follow up work has been done. The mineralisation extends for 15Om in a north south direction. but is interpreted to have a true width of less than 1m. The copper mineralisation has been introduced with quartz veining (1-2m thick) which is now hosted in boudins along the shear (see Figures 9 and 10).

The upcoming drill campaign will also include an aligned programme of diamond coring to supply physical materials for comprehensive metallurgical studies targeting comminution test work, and flotation test, based on the expected feed ratios for the fresh and transition ores and leaching test. work, as well as initial variability testing to support future economic evaluation of Mumbezhi Project. This work will also directly inform a proposed Scoping Study for Mumbezhi which is due for. publication in early 2025. Earlier metallurgical studies carried out by the previous owners (ORP) produced encouraging results based on flotation work on both the fresh and transition ores, providing a solid footing for future studies to be undertaken by Prospect. It is expected that the maiden mineral resource estimation work underway will provide suitable domaining of oxide, transition and fresh material splits to further support the metallurgical test work. studies. On the ground in Zambia, Prospect staff have now mobilised to site who have begun setting up camp facilities and logistical support for the upcoming drilling activities and field-based. Environmental and Social Impact Activity (ESIA) studies. The latter work has been awarded to an experienced and well-credentialled local Zambian company, Mvc Consulting Engineers Ltd, who have considerable exposure to similar copper project studies and investigations in the country. The ESIA activities will directly support the Company's proposed later application for mining leases at Mumbezhi, and foster and integrate local community involvement into the Project, in line with Prospect's stated Corporate Social Investment plan and initiatives. Prospect staff were recently invited to visit the local Chiefs, whose Chiefdoms cover the area overlain by Prospect's exploration licence in the Northwestern Province of Zambia Representatives from Prospect and GDC were warmly received and this sets the platform for more detailed community interaction once site-based activities commence later this month.

A geological log of WMc diamond drillhole MSGD010, which was sited on the footwall side of the Bull Oak  Reef, identified the Faugh-A-Ballagh reef as 40 cm of ironstained quartz from ~48 m below surface. The Kohinoor North Reef was seen as a cluster of quartz veins at 127 m below surface. Another 40 cm vein was seen at 102 m below surface. Depth of weathering is interpreted from drilling data to be approximately 60 m. The water table is reported as approximately 35 m below surface.. In general, the Bull Oak deposit has a northwest strike and dips to the northeast approximately 30 degrees The Worker Granite is a porphyritic intrusion approximately 1km south of Bull Oak. Drill samples show the fresh rock to be a porphyritic, biotite granodiorite. Historical production records indicate that a quartz reef within the granite, striking 330 degrees with a 25 degree dip to the south-east, was mined to produce approximately 1,328 ounces from 1,135 tonnes. Mineralisation at the Hill View prospect appears to be associated with a north-east trending banded-iron- formation within mafic rocks that dips steeply to the south-east. Historical production records indicate that approximately 200 ounces was produced from approximately 400 tons. Drillhole Drillhole collar and relevant information for drill holes with significant gold mineralisation is included in a information table in the main report.. Page |16 ",

Sample MER386 assayed 52.8g/t Au with 12.35% Cu Attina is located just 5.5 km NE of Carnaby's (AsX: CNB) Mt Hope Deposit and comprises sub crop of a discontinuous line of gossanous quartz veins varying from 1m to 15m wide, which has been traced for up to 700m .The peak pXRF soil anomaly is 0.4% Cu (pXRF) located in the center of the grid next. to gossanous rock chip sample MER163 which contains 7.47% Cu and 0.31 g/t Au  The anomalous Cu area has quartz veining and gossanous mineralisation in the core of the soil anomaly, that stretches for 300m Iong > 500ppm Cu  The Cu-Au anomalism is hosted in Corella metasediments, deforming around the Overlander Granite, with mafic intrusions in the Iocalised arcuate major structure. CPM interprets this as a possible low lithospheric pressure shadow providing a favourable trap site for Cu-Au mineralisation  pXRF soil sampling at the Solo Cu-Au Prospect has also identified two copper in soil anomalies around 3oom Iong each. The eastern anomaly is located on the sheared contact between the Corella Formation and the Overlander Granite Cooper Metals Managing Director, lan Warland commented: \"These two new Prospects are showing highly encouraging Cu-Au anomalism in soils and rock chips located in favourable structural positions. The areas were followed up as part of an external prospectivity review of the Ardmore tenement in 2023, which helped identify eleven targets from a desktop review of detailed aeromagnetic data, geological mapping and satellite imagery. Attina looks especially interesting, due to the high gold grades and the. interpretation of a complex trap site formed potentially in a zone of low pressure, which resulted in increased shearing around the contact between a rigid granite body within the Corella Formation. We are continuing to improve the geochemical coverage and mapping to assess these areas for future drill testing and look forward to updating the market with our progress.\" Cooper Metals Limited ABN: 16 647 594 956 www.coopermetals.com.au A: Level 8, 216 St Georges Tce, Perth WA 6000 I P: +61 (08) 9481 0389 | E: enquiries@coopermetals.com.au ",

The regional strike is north-northwest and the dip 20o west-southwest. The Camboon Andesite consists of andesitic and basaltic lava, with agglomerate, tuff and some inter-bedded trachytic volcanics. The andesitic lavas are typically porphyritic, with phenocrysts of plagioclase feldspar (oligoclase or andesine) and less commonly augite. To the west, the Camboon Andesite is overlain with an interpreted disconformity by fossiliferous limestone of the Buffel Formation. It is. unconformably underlain to the east by the Torsdale Beds, which consist of rhyolitic and dacitic lavas and pyroclastics with inter-bedded trachytic and andesitic volcanics, sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate. 2. Mineralisation is hosted in steeply dipping low sulphidation epithermal veins. These veins found as discrete and as stockwork and are composed of quartz, carbonate and adularia, with varying percentages of each mineral.  Vein textures include banding (colloform, crustiform, cockade, moss), breccia channels and massive quartz, and indicate depth within the epithermal system. Sulphide percentage in the veins are generally low (<3%) primarily composed of pyrite, with minor occurrences of hessite, sphalerite and galena. Rare chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and bornite can also be found. 3. Alteration of the country rock can be extensive and zone from the central veined structure. This alteration consists of silicification, phyllic alteration (silica, sericite and other clay minerals) and argillic alteration in the inner zone, grading outwards to potassic (adularia) then an outer propylitic zone. Gold is very fined grained and found predominantly as electrum but less common within clots of pyrite. Drill hole information 1.

A strong geochemical anomaly indicative of pathfinder elements associated with precious / base metal mineralisation was highlighted from interpretation of existing and re-assayed drill data at the Mageye Prospect. The presence of an underlying distinct 'bullseye' geophysical anomaly suggests an intrusion near-surface, supporting intrusion-related mineralisation models. Drill planning to further explore the potential of this anomaly is underway. Westar CEO Jason Boladeras commented: \"The significant pathfinder geochemical signature we've identified as Mageye is supported by a strong geophysical anomaly defined by not one but two techniques, creating a compelling exploration target. We're now eager to drill this target to understand if there is any gold / base metal mineralisation is associated with it.

Northern Pegmatite E deposit was successfully targeted, with the deepest hole. CDDo90, intersecting high lithia grades over a true width of ~7.6m, at a vertical depth of 130m -- showing the deposit is open and thickening at depth. Pegmatite C (which co-joins WinBin) also returned encouraging intersections at depth from two earlier holes that were re-entered during Phase 4, with hole CDD042 showing that the deposit is still open at 130m vertically from surface.

Key Points: Great Eastern Gold Ltd (GEG) and GDM have signed an MOU to explore toll treatment services for GDM's Yellow Jack ore at GEG's nearby Big Rush site GEG holds the Big Rush Gold Mine, 14km from GDM's Yellow Jack deposit  MOu includes a six-month exclusivity provision and confidentiality Potentially compressed project timelines & reduced CAPEX Commenting on this update, Chief Executive Officer of Great Divide Mining, Justin Haines, said: \"This is a great step forward for GDM's plan for Yellow Jack. Working with Great Eastern will allow us to explore process options on their Big Rush site which will reduce our schedule and cAPex for development of Yellow Jack.\" \"Finalising a commercial Toll Treatment Agreement, will allow GDM to complete Mine Optimisation at Yellow Jack which will lead to the development of a Mining Lease application for the project, \"he said. \"'Collaboration and co-operation is a Win:Win for both our companies.\" Yellow Jack Project Confirmatory drilling at Yellow Jack in January 2024 enabled the commencement of geological and mining optimisation studies. These studies were temporarily suspended pending the development of a low-CAPEX processing option for Yellow Jack ores. GEG's Big Rush site is 14km from the Yellow Jack deposit which will significantly reduce haulage costs compared to other potential processing options. GDM will work with GEG's technical team to develop a processing solution suitable for both parties with the intention of reaching a binding commercial Toll Treatment Agreement as soon as possible.

The results show the highly fractionated, fertile nature of the pegmatites identified during the initial field trip with average K/Rb ratios <40. The results show elevated Niobium (up to 128ppm), Tantalum (196ppm) and anomalous levels of Gallium (up to 61.7ppm). The rock chip results themselves represent single point samples on individual pegmatites that extend over 200m in strike and will be used to guide an expanded field mapping and sampling campaign which. is planned to further expand the pegmatite field and to further test the prospectivity of the tenure north of the identified pegmatites. 821000 821500E 82200 29 820000E 820500E 821000E 822000 Figure 2.

A comprehensive Air Quality Impact Assessment (AQIA) has been undertaken that considers both existing emissions from the site as well as new emissions from the proposed Refinery. The AQIA demonstrates that the emissions from the site are significantly less than the prescribed Ground Levels Concentrations for all relevant pollutants at receiver locations around the site. A Biodiversity Assessment has been completed which justifies the clearing of a smal amount of highly degraded vegetation at the site. The Work Approval application will be submitted to DwER in the coming months. Potential offtake partners are assessing larger-scale sulphate samples produced from these sources.

The 3km x 1.5km copper-in-soil footprint has an internal 2.5km x 0.5km gold-in-soil anomaly and is associated with a suite of elevated elements related to iron-oxide-copper-gold (IOcG) systems including U, Co, Ce, La, Ba, Bi, & K. Tamba is located along geophysical structures which extends through the 'Arcee' gold prospect? located on the WA-NT boarder approximately 7 kms to the southeast.. In 2019 Norwest completed a first pass 3000-point regional soil program across the bulk of its Arunta West project area. The results were followed up with fine-fraction collection of a further 6,550 soil samples which infilled areas of geochemical interest. These samples were analysed for 48 elements including ultra-low detection (0.01 ppb) for gold with the final lab assay results reported in early 20224. Detailed analysis was undertaken independently by a consulting geochemist who identified the Tamba anomaly as one of several high priority dril targets along with areas at Malibu and Duck.. The Arcee gold prospect is currently held by Prodigy Gold (Asx: PRx) and located 7 km southeast of Tamba. RC drilling at Arcee in 2019 returned 12m @ 3.5g/t gold from 113m. Arcee was originally identified using 2ppb gold in soil results5. Subsequent exploration work has extended the Arcee gold anomaly to 2.3km with the anomaly crossing onto Tali Exploration ground.

Highlights: Vera's Gossan Prospect. GAP Geophysics have completed the MLEM survey and detected three. large EM anomalies beneath, extending south and remain open to the north of the outcropping gossan. Rock chip sampling of Vera's Gossan returned highly anomalous assays with the peak sample being NRR00004 with nickel at 2750ppm, copper at. 1119ppm, cobalt at 1370ppm, zinc at 3180ppm and sulphur at 1360ppm (Asx: \"Vera's Gossan confirmed as a nickel copper target 21/05/2024\"). The gossan is 13kms directly west of the Masson Prospect nickel, copper,. cobalt and PGE massive sulphide discovery - continuing to show the fertile sulphide mineralisation of the region. Nimy Executive Director Luke Hampson said: \"The MLEM survey at Vera's Gossan has identified three large EM anomalies. The survey follows the discovery of a mineralised gossan and indicates possible base metal. sulphide mineralisation after assaying of the gossan returned anomalous levels of. nickel, copper, cobalt and zinc. The GAIP survey at Block 3 is complete with results imminent, our exploration strategy. continues to unlock the potential of the newly identified greenstone belts within. Nimy's 3004km? Mons Project holding. A drill program is now being planned at Vera's Gossan and will be completed along with the Masson Discovery drilling and Block 3 GAlP survey recommendations.\".

The prospective corridor, we refer to as the Collerina Copper Trend, extends south from the Aeris copper tenements through Helix's Eastern Group Tenements for over 100km of strike length. The new auger results, which only test part of this corridor, continue to confirm this is a major prospective zone with signatures indicative of copper-gold mineralisation such as those occurring at Aeris' Tritton Copper Operations - which have been producing 20-30ktpa of copper plus gold for the past 30 years. strongest signatures for new copper gold discoveries. New targets can be rapidly advanced in the Helix pipeline to cover, aircore drilling. Over the past six months, Helix has focused on advancing several priority targets in its pipeline which we believe have potential to deliver a new copper-gold discovery in the highly endowed, Cobar region close to established operations and processing facilities.\". Technical Report - Auger Results Further assay results have been received for 809 auger samples from the Eastern Group tenements. Broad multi- kilometre scale antimony (Sb) and arsenic (As) anomalies were reported previously? at the Alderbaran and Max's Folly prospects west of the CZ Copper Project. Sb and As are important pathfinder elements for gold (Au) and copper (Cu). Recently received assay results for the Widgelands, Honeybugle, lowaba and Tarawera areas, confirm new Sb and Au anomalies at all four prospects (Figure 1). There are numerous areas of Au anomalism although the scale of these anomalies is currently unconstrained due to results that are still pending and holes that failed as they did not reach bedrock (Figures 2 and 3). There are also numerous historical auger samples that were not analysed for Au previously A large proportion of failed holes (i.e. auger holes that did not reach through alluvial cover to bedrock) are present at Honeybugle, reflecting the deeper transported cover depth in this area, which is about 3m vertical and deepening to the north (Figure 2).. Most of the area comprising the Eastern Group tenements is situated within extensive floodplains associated with major tributaries of the Bogan River. In general, the depth of Quaternary alluvial cover deepens towards the major tributaries, such as Pangee Creek and Whitbarrow Creek (Figure 1). Therefore, there has been no previous exploration undertaken where the alluvial cover crosses the prospective structural corridor, and these areas will need to be tested with aircore drilling..

The project. consists of two Exploration Licences, E29/1053 and E36/1015, covering a combined area of 124 km? and is located within the Kalgoorlie Terrane of the Yilgarn Craton. The Ida Valley Project is situated in an emerging world-class lithium province with test work to establish the lithium fertility of the project ongoing.. The project has previously been subject to soil sampling surveys and RC drilling targeting gold mineralisation along the Delta Lithium's Mt Ida deposit (14.7Mt @ 1.2% LiO; Refer to DLI ASX announcement 8th August 2023) and 100km The Bannockburn gold mine is approximately 40km east of Ida Valley's new Pinnacles gold target.. In late April 2024, the Company completed an 11-hole RC drilling program to test a soil gold anomaly (Pinnacle) and. two priority lithium-caesium-tantalum soil anomalies (Central & Northern). The program consisted of two east-west drill lines. Assay results have now been received from all samples returning an inaugural high-grade gold intercept of Zone and remains open along strike to both the north and south. Drilling did not intersect significant lithium mineralisation, however given favourable lithium-caesium-tantalum (LcT) soils geochemistry, exploration efforts wil focus on the Pinnacles gold discovery while LCT style geology will continue to be tested with imminent planned exploration. Ongoing work at Ida Valley includes assessing the along strike potential of the high-grade gold intercept returned from the northern zone and assessing the lithium potential of the remaining project area..

Eagle and Diucon are located in the west of Hemi, as shown in Figure 1. This release provides an update on drilling since the previous report on Diucon and Eagle extensional drilling released to the ASX on 14 November 2023, and a more recent update including Antwerp and Gorrion results released on 13 February 2024. Recent drilling has continued to target extensions to the November 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) at Eagle and Aquila. The Hemi Gold Project Definitive Feasibility Study (DFs), based on the June 2023 MRE, was released on 28 September 2023, and demonstrates a robust, Tier 1 project with outstanding financial metrics. The new extensional drill results in this release represent further upside to the DFS outcomes. There is. potential for the extensions to be considered in future mining plans. New drill results are shown in Table 1 at the end of the announcement. Eagle Extensional and Infill Drilling Since the November 2023 MRE and the 14 November 2023 Diucon-Eagle drilling ASX update, widely spaced drilling (nominally 80m x 80m) down plunge and down dip at Eagle has continued, together with some infill holes where previous drilling was very widely spaced. This has demonstrated substantial extensions to known mineralisation. Significant results from this work include: 4.6m @ 31.8g/t Au from 501.4m including 1.1m @ 130.5g/t Au from 501.8m in HEDD255 20.4m @ 4.0g/t Au from 399.4m including 0.9m @ 19.0g/t Au from 399.4m and 0.7m @ 79.7g/t Au from 418.7m in HEDD257  16.5m @ 1.8g/t Au from 660.0m including 7.5m @ 3.4g/t Au from 669.0m in HEDD258  19.3m @ 1.0g/t Au from 631.0m, 12.2m @ 1.0g/t Au from 664.1m and 5.8m @ 1.6g/t Au from 689.1m in HEDD259 7.0m @ 1.2g/t Au from 575.0m and 20m @ 1.8g/t Au from 588.0m, including 4m @ 4.3g/t Au from 588.0m in HMRC018D  47.0m @ 1.6g/t Au from 522.0m, including 7m @ 4.3g/t Au from 522.0m and 29.2m @ 1.4g/t Au from 576.8m in HMRC646D Recent significant intersections from Eagle are shown in plan view in Figure 2 and in long section view in Figure 3. Drilling has extended mineralisation at Eagle beyond the November 2023 MRE for around. 200m down plunge. Recent drilling demonstrates strong potential to expand the November 2023 MRE.

Levels observed are consistent with metal enrichment in upper portions of a porphyry Cu- Au system distal from the potassic core.  Project review underway to assess future Bethanga exploration strategy Nexus Minerals Limited (Asx: Nxm, \"the Company\" or \"Nexus\") is pleased to present the results of the diamond drilling program recently completed at Bethanga, which is situated 260km northeast of Melbourne in Victoria. Drilling was completed in April, with the subsequent analytical and interpretation process now complete.. Nexus Managing Director Andy Tudor commented \"Receiving results marks the completion of the a Cu-Au porphyry system the results have continued to demonstrate fertility and indicate the potential. presence of such a system. The program has offered further insight into the project and presents an opportunity to continue vectoring towards the potential potassic core where highest metal grades typically occur. The exploration team will continue to review the results and exploration strategy on the project.\" Diamond Drilling Program During the first quarter of 2024 Nexus completed a diamond drill campaign at the Bethanga Project,. Victoria. Three deep drill holes were completed over the course of the campaign for a total of 1,516. metres. The program targeted magnetic and geochemical targets within the multi-element and copper target zones identified in the prior porphyry Cu-Au fertility study (refer to ASX: NXM 9/3/2023).

A total of 84 samples were collected for laboratory analysis, which included 4-acid Iithogeochemical analysis, fire assay and hyperspectral analysis. Sampling focused on areas of obvious alteration and trace mineralisation (sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite), as well as spaced samples throughout the holes to provide information on hydrothermal alteration. The results of this analysis have now been received and a preliminary analysis undertaken to improve understanding of the system.

Commenting on the results, Managing Director Andrew Pardey, said: \"With PDI's PFS outlining attractive optimisation opportunities from further resource development work, we have renewed our focus on this as we move forward with the early stages of our DFs field work.\" \"The initial results at BC are very encouraging and confirm there is potential to upgrade Inferred Mineral Resources just below the PFS pit designs, which could ultimately lead to an increase in the current 207Koz BC Ore Reserve.' Encouragingly, drilling also encountered positive intercepts outside the overall Mineral Resource estimate.\" 'We are also pleased to advance the 8oow and SB targets from exploration to resource development drilling.

Figure 2: Lake Giles Project Location The Lake Giles tenements cover the Yerilgee greenstone belt located in the central part of the Southern Cross Province of the Yilgarn Archaean Craton. The region is characterized by lenticular greenstone belts often partly ultramafic, mafic and sediments, including BIF which are Archean in age and are commonly intruded by mafic intermediate, and granitic rocks. The prospective ultramafic rocks of the Project are interpreted to be of Kambalda komatiite type. Serpentinised olivine cumulate rocks sometimes metamorphosed to talc-carbonate occur in many places and are considered to have a high potential for the discovery of nickel sulphides. These have similar characteristics to those of the Forrestania and Lake Johnston greenstone belts. The Lake Johnston nickel mineralised bodies such as Maggie Hays, are hosted within a Kambalda style ultramafic komatiite, which is an upturned volcanic flow against a basaltic basal unit.

The Reynolds Springs Project is located approximately 180 miles (300 km) north of Las Vegas, Nevada, and 330 miles (531 km) southeast of Tesla's new Gigafactory. A total of 206 soil samples were collected across the full extent of the Reynolds Springs Project. Lithium values in the soil samples ranged from a low of 39.3 ppm to a high of 405 ppm Li. Samples were consistently high These results are considered high in comparison to the majority of non-lithium producing play as and amongst the highest we have seen outside of the Clayton Valley. In 2018 the Company completed an assessment of downhole geophysical logs for 12 - 15 abandoned oil and gas wells that are found both within (5 wells) and in the near vicinity of the project.

The drillhole, a total of 507.0 m, was targeting the extension of both high grade and bulk disseminated sulphide mineralisation to the west of the known mineral deposit. Assay results confirm the presence of both high-grade and disseminated sulphide mineralisation. All three mineralised domains were intersected in the anticipated locations of the drillhole, displaying continuity of the known mineralisation(Refer: Figure 1). The high-grade footwall mineralisation consists of massive and semi-massive sulphide veins that are found in proximity to the gabbro-gneiss contact(Refer: Figure 3). The high-grade footwall intersection in this drillhole is1.04%NiEq(0.40Ni%,1.02%Cu, and 0.02%Co) over 2.4 m from 473.2m downhole(Refer: Table 2). The inner high-grade mineralisation is interpreted as a\"net-textured sulphide breccia\" which consists of multiple intersections of massive and semi massive veins with random orientation found within moderately  mineralised gabbro with disseminated to blebby textured sulphides(Refer: Figure 4). The inner high-grade intersection in this drillhole is 0.83%NiEq(0.46%Ni, 0.57%Cu, 0.03%Co, 0.12 g/t Au) over 15.2 m(Refer: Table 2), with notable copper and gold grades to 3.95%Cu and 2.33 g/t Au(0.4 m from 407.1 m). A relative abundance of chalcopyrite to pyrrhotite in this zone is reflected by the elevated copper and gold values. Disseminated mineralisation is widespread within the intrusion with mineralisation starting from at approx. 115 m depth in drillhole KNI-ER006 and extends to the gneiss contact at ~467 m. The average grade across this disseminated 343.3 m long section of core is 0.20%NiEq (0.13%Ni, 0.10%Cu,0.01%Co)-(Refer: Table 2). This section contains disseminated to massive sulphides and sulphides increases in abundance. downhole toward to the contact(Refer: Figure 3). The style of mineralisation, textures and spatial association, share similarities with conduit-style Ni-Cu deposits like Voisey's Bay.

Our recent focus on the areas surrounding and between historic mining areas has identified several exciting opportunities which could add further. resources to our near-term profile at Hillgrove. The initial exploration target is another positive outcome for our Hillgrove exploration team following the exceptional high-grade results we announced last month from the recent diamond drilling program at Bakers Creek. We are looking forward to further work to define the target and planning future exploration programs to grow the project.\". Exploration Target The estimated range of potential mineralisation for the Exploration Target is (Table 1):. 2.8 - 3.6 million tonnes grading at 7.4 to 9.46 g/t AuEq  670,000 to 1,080,000 oz AuEq The approximate Exploration Target ranges are listed in Table 1 and locations shown in Figure 1 as sections along A - A' and B -B'..

The Exploration Target is exclusive of the December 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate released for the Hilgrove project of 1.4M oz @ 6.1g/t AuEq. Cautionary Statement: The potential quantity and grade of the Exploration Target is conceptual in nature and therefore is an. approximation. There has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the estimation of a Mineral Resource. The Exploration Target has been prepared and reported in accordance with the JORC Code 2012 Edition. The Exploration Target is based on the following key assumptions: Continuity of mineralisation at the Eleanora-Garibaldi Exploration Target to a depth of 800m. below surface, as exists at the Bracken Spur deposit. Continuity of mineralisation at the Metz Exploration Target to a depth of 1,ooom below surface,. as exists at the Syndicate deposit. Application of standard industry estimation methodologies. Extensive historical mining and exploration information. Figure 1 also details the extensive mineralised lode system at Hillgrove with the areas mined in. highlighted blue and under-explored areas in red. All areas are open at depth.. The Exploration Target is located below the current inferred mineral resources at Eleanora-Garibaldi. and Metz mining centres and highlights high-grade mineralisation potential proximal to recent and.

Helicopter magnetic and radiometric surveying for the GeoDAwN project was carried out by EDcON- PRJ Inc. using 200 m line spacing covering both Morella's FLV Li-brine project claims and Albemarle's. nearby CVBO (Figure 1). This helimagnetic survey data was subsequently processed and interpreted by Perth based geophysical consultants Resource Potentials Pty Ltd, who filtered, imaged and 3D inversion modelled the data to update Morella's existing interpretation of basin-bounding faults, sedimentary troughs, rift-related structures and volcanic features beneath the playa valley floor which may control the formation of Li- bearing brine deposits similar to the CVBO located only 35 km to the east. Figure 1 shows the FLV Project Area and Albemarle's CVBO over a magnetic anomaly image generated from GeoDAwN data.

The updated basin interpretation combines the GeoDAwN results with Morella's high-resolution 2D seismic reflection survey results and additional geophysical survey data acquired by Morella such as. magnetotelluric (MT) and passive seismic survey lines crossing the basin. As shown in Figure 2, this results in the interpreted rift basin fault and transfer structures. Note the location of 2D seismic line 3 shown in Figure 3 and the location of planned seismic line 5 to be acquired for Morella A key outcome from the new magnetic survey results was tracking the western rift border fault to the north of the FLV project area, extending from the 2D seismic reflection survey lines (see Figures 2 and. 3). This basin controlling rift border fault is hidden below the playa valley floor and forms the footwall. to an interpreted hanging-wall conglomerate deposit and multi-layered sediment-ash porous reservoir target zone which can be interpreted from high-resolution 2D seismic reflection line 3 (Figure 3).

Significant Li brine drill target to be tested following seismic survey results Overview Morella Corporation Limited (Asx: 1Mc, \"Morella\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to announce that it has completed a study using recently released, helicopter borne high resolution magnetic and. radiometric survey data (\"GeoDAwN\") from the US Geological Survey (UsGs) and US Department of Energy (Doe). Coordinated with this effort was the collection of airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data (conducted through the UsGS 3DEP Program) that yielded detailed surface topographic models of the terrain over a similar extent spanned by the geophysical surveys. This data complements the Company's interpretation of the 2D seismic reflection survey results in the southern area of the Fish Lake Valley (\"FLV\") lithium brine project in Nevada, USA1. The processed, imaged, modelled and interpreted magnetic results plus the LiDAR data has defined seismic reflection interpretation of deep rift basin geology. The combined data set indicates the FLV project area has strong similarities to the rift basin and structures hosting lithium brines at Albemarle's Silver Peak lithium brine mine in Clayton Valley (\"CvBO\"), located 35 kilometres to the east. Morella Managing Director James Brown said:. \"The UsGS and DOE GeoDAwN program survey data has significantly boosted Morella's understanding of key fault structures which control basin development and formation of potential lithium brine reservoirs at FLV. This new information complements our recent 2D seismic reflection survey results and bodes well for future lithium brine development. The GeoDAwN program was funded by the US government and the immediate utilisation of this survey data package is proving to be extremely valuable for Morella in. understanding the FLV project.\" The GeoDAwN data was commissioned by the UsGS and DOE to promote exploration and development of critical minerals and is released free of charge to users.'

We have been opportunistic in our work out here with time between the Company's drill. campaigns at Black Range and Bauloora earlier last month. This has allowed the exploration team to visit several key areas and it's exciting to see new targets identified including Jethro and Hillview.. Ground truthing focused on following up priority multi-element soil geochemical anomalies and areas of interest, identified during AEM modelling and noted in the aeromagnetic data. Encouragingly, a number of these areas are returning with anomalous pathfinder's indicative of Cobar-type base and precious metal mineralisation, with structural complexity observable on surface, and the discovery of gossan which may be a surface expression of primary mineralisation at depth. Legacy Minerals is also pleased to have further work being completed by the Nsw Government in the form of two recently completed seismic lines across the northern and southern areas of the Project. We look forward to receiving that data and keeping shareholders updated as we progress the project.\". 10km EL9511 COBAR GM100% Great Cobar New Cobar Woggle Chesney W 6,510 New Occidental 1.5g/t Au Lag Peak Gold Mine Perseverance 0.43g/t Au Lag Langtons (2m at 12g/t Au from 20m) Yarrawonga M_40310 Xcite_6 40160A Hillview Central Cobar Project Jethro Legend Mine OMineral Occurrence 40060A Roads Faults 40020A Geophysical Anomalies Magnetic and AEM Targets AEM Targets Geochemical Targets 390,000mE Figure 4: Northern Cobar Project Area, key prospects, mines, and mineral occurrences L LEGACY SIGN UP TO LEGACY MINERALS' ASX: LGM MINERALS INTERACTIVE INVESTOR HUB ",

The first hole is being drilled at Copper Canyon South, where limited previous drilling encountered thick, high grade gold mineralisation at depth, including 38m @ 3.7g/t Au from 760m in EOksc16801 (Figure 2). The current hole is designed to test for an up-dip extension of the mineralisation, which if successful will demonstrate the mineralisation at a much-shallower position. Following completion of the current hole at Copper Canyon South, the rig will move to the Veleiki Prospect. Veleiki is a. conceptual target for copper-gold porphyry mineralisation, characterised by the following key technical criteria:  The strongest molybdenum in soil response in the project, with coincident gold, copper, bismuth and arsenic anomalism; Extensive advanced Argillic alteration at surface; Strongly anomalous geophysical responses, including IP Chargeability, Resistivity and Remanent Magnetism (REM); and Favourable geological setting, at the intersection of major NW and NE-trending faults. While the exploration phase of drilling has now commenced, the Company has three drill rigs focused on systematic. resource drilling at both the Shanac and Medenovac deposits, with the aim of growing the Mineral Resources and. improving the definition of higher-grade mineralisation zones. The first hole at Shanac is now complete and the second. hole should be completed within the week, with initial assay results expected in early-August.

Resource Estimate of 5.71 Mlbs U3O; at average 630ppm  Planned rights entitlement offer to all shareholders on the same terms as the recent placement - details to be provided in due course. Following the recently completed placement to sophisticated and institutional shareholders, GTI. Energy Ltd (GTI or Company) is pleased to provide an update on the upcoming resource expansion drilling program at the Lo Herma ISR uranium project in Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB). In advance of further news related to progress of the planned drill program at Lo Herma, the following provides a summary of the resource expansion potential and objectives of the 2024 Phase Il drilling. As previously advised on 2nd of May 2024, the planned 2024 drilling permit at Lo Herma allows for. up to 76 drill hole locations including construction of up to 5 groundwater monitoring wells. This next mineral resource classification (Table 1). Collection of important data including, hydrogeologic parameters of the mineralised aquifers and collection of rock core samples for metallurgical testing. will be also prioritised. GTI intends to mobilise drilling rigs to Lo Herma as soon as the activity is fully permitted which is anticipated to be during late July or early August 2024.. Following completion of the 2024 drill program at Lo Herma, GTI intends to publish an updated mineral resource estimate and exploration target range for the project. The Company expects that the updated mineral resource estimate will support near-term development of a Scoping Study to demonstrate the economic potential of the project. GTI Executive Director Bruce Lane commented, \"We are pleased and excited to have received investor support and funding to continue moving forward with our planned resource expansion drilling at Lo Herma. Matt and the team in Wyoming have put us in a great position to complete the drilling program this quarter, with a revised mineral resource estimate to be rapidly advanced post-drilling. this year on the basis that we can significantly grow the uranium resource estimate to a similar scale to ISR uranium mines currently being constructed or planned in Wyoming at Ur-Energy's Shirley Basin project & Encore's Energy's Gas Hills project.\" GTi EnergyLtd Carbon GTienergy- 333c Charles Street +6189226 2011 Neutral North Perth WA 6006 E info@gtienergy.au ",

The 2024 program has built on the successful field campaigns completed last. year, which confirmed the presence of high-grade spodumene mineralisation across a 5km prospective corridor at Falcon Lake.  In addition, prospecting teams focused on mapping and prospecting under-. explored regional tenure at Falcon West and Falcon East. The new discovery will be added to the list of priority drill targets across the 5km mineralised corridor at Falcon Lake Lithium Project, significantly enhancing the Project's exploration potential. Battery Age Minerals Ltd (ASX: Bm8; \"Battery Age\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to advise that it has discovered extensive mineralised spodumene-bearing pegmatite at the Falcon Extension Property, part of its Falcon Lake Lithium Project in Ontario, Canada. The exciting discovery stems from the Company's recently completed four-week Spring across the broader project.. The new discovery located at Falcon Extension, which was acquired late last year, adds further potential scale to the known mineralised corridor at Falcon Lake and increases the list of priority drilling targets to be tested during the upcoming summer drill program.. The focused 2024 Spring Fieldwork Program has built on successful field campaigns completed last year, which identified over 30 outcropping pegmatites and confirmed the presence of spodumene mineralisation across a 5km prospective corridor (Figure 1). The Spring Program was designed to investigate major regional structures in favourable volcanogenic stratigraphy, focusing on areas of elevated topographic relief. In addition, the in- field team collected 379 bedrock rock chip samples (Appendix 1, Table 1) from all outcrops encountered across the Falcon East, Falcon West and Falcon Extension properties (Figure 2) including LCT pegmatite intrusions.

As we navigate through the necessary environmental approvals and land access requirements, we are preparing to commence drilling in early Q3 CY2024.. The high grades presented are the result of detailed surface sampling conducted in regions where initial reconnaissance identified anomalous REE grades.Due to the density of the samples collected and the observed rare earth and titanium oxide grades, three exploration prospects were defined: Patos de Minas, Lagoa Formosa, and Chumbo. At the Chumbo Prospect, detailed surface sampling is still ongoing. Samples were collected along road cuts and within private rural properties, maintaining an approximate distance of 200 meters between samples.

        "text": "INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL SPECIALISTS REPORT R183.2024 Mineral Assets Of Cobre Ltd This geological framework is considered a favourable situation for MVT lead-zinc mineralisation as, for example, the Lennard Shelf lead-zinc deposits in the Canning Basin of Devonian age. These deposits form by hydrothermal fluids coming up from deep fault fractures, and leaching metals (like lead, zinc, barium) from basement sources, and precipitating them as sulphides and sulphates in carbonate and pyritic rocks. Another possible metallogenic style that can form within this craton-margin geological framework is VMs, if there are localised volcanic rocks in the system. There is no record of volcanics in either the Devonian or Permian sequences in the Carnarvon Basin, but they could be present at depths further into the basin, and not yet intersected by petroleum wildcat wells. The only post-basement magmatic activity known in the region is the Wandagee picritic Iamprophyres (Lewis 1990). These are mantle-tapping funnel-shaped diatremes that intrude the Permian Lyons River Group. Altogether there are 23 such diatremes, forming a diffuse cluster. Jurassic in age and relate to the break up of Gondwana. They have been explored for diamonds without success. There are no documented diatremes within E09/2316. Although there is a spatial relationship with the rifted margin of the cratonic Gascoyne Province, it is unlikely such diatremes can provide a magmatic fluid or heat source for barium and any related metals.. 3.2.3 LOCAL GEOLOGY Figure 50 shows the fault complex with northeast and northwest-trending components that. disrupts the unconformity between the basal Permian Harris Sandstone and the basement metamorphic rocks. Also shown is the older Devonian Gneudna Limestone which is on-lapped and obscured by the Permian lithologies. The barite occurrences, as best is presently known, are mostly restricted to the Permian Harris Sandstone. Also shown is the best plot of the Arimco drillholes which were all collared in the Harris Sandstone.. The surface distribution of the Gneudna carbonates shown in Fiqure 50, would be a suitable host for Mvt lead-zinc mineralisation. Its distribution beneath the Permian-aged sediments is unknown and is considered an important aspect of understanding the prospect-scale framework for potential sediment-hosted mineralisation. 3.2.4 BARITE Based on the abundance of barite (BasO4) in this area, which remains unexplained, it is appropriate to comment on its significance. Barite usually occurs in two forms:. Bedded barite - occurring peripheral to MVT lead-zinc deposits and VMS base metal deposits Bedded barite, therefore, possesses the geochemical alteration and metal signatures of these deposits. Vein barite - occurring in discord fracture-fills, generally lacking other elements and with no immediate spatial relationship with bedded barite. It is reasonable to postulate that vein barite has been remobilised from bedded barite during a later hydrothermal event. Page 101 ",

WOODY LITHIUM PROJECT (TAMBOURAH SOUTH) The Woody Lithium Project (formerly Tambourah South) is Infinity's flagship Lithium Project.The project lies just 65 km SE of the Pilgangoora Lithium mine operated by Pilbara Minerals Ltd (see Figure 2). After the initial discovery of lithium pegmatites at Woody in 2022, Infinity has continued to discover more lithium-bearing pegmatite bodies during 2023. Tenement E45/5720 was acquired in 2023, which lies directly NE of the Woody tenement E45/4848, increasing the Infinity's footprint over this exciting Lithium project. A significant amount of exploration was completed by Infinity during the annual period to 31 March 2024 at the. Woody Project, including: Reporting of results from Infinity's maiden RC drilling Program. Infinity completed its maiden Lithium drilling. program at Woody in late 2022, with a total advance of 1,812 m RC drilling in 21 holes.Over 50 assays of 1m RC samples returned between 0.20% Li2O and a maximum of 0.994% Li2O (see ASX Announcement 20 April 2023). A second RC drilling program of 8 holes for a total advance of 834 metres drilling, intersected additional lithium- bearing pegmatites. A total of 23 pegmatite intervals varying in width from 1m up to 25m were logged in the RC drill holes, with each hole logging at least 1m pegmatite. The highest lithium assay was 1 m @ 2.1% Li20, 1,060 ppm Rb, 119 ppm Cs and 80 ppm Ta, in hole TM23RC026 from 31 m depth. The thickest high-grade intersection of tantalum returned 8 m @ 118 ppm Ta, within RC Drillhole TM23RC2023 (see Figure 3).Details are included in ASX Announcements 17 October 2023, 22 November 2023 and 8 February 2024. Mapping of newly discovered pegmatite bodies at surface shows a combined strike length of over 5.7km, with. pegmatite units returned anomalous assays up to 3.7% Li20 (see Figure 4).

The Rox group holds 100% of all mineral rights at the Youanmi Gold Project, including nearby extensions, and between 90% to 100% of gold rights in the regional tenure (See Figure 1). The Youanmi Gold Project has produced an estimated 667,000oz of gold (at 5.47g/t Au) since its discovery in 1894 during three main periods: 1908 to 1921, 1937 to 1942 and 1987 to 1997. The last parcel of ore mined underground at Youanmi (in November 1997) was processed at a grade of 14.6g/t Au. The structure of the Youanmi Gold Project is dominated by the north-trending Youanmi Fault Zone. Most of the gold mineralisation found at the Project is hosted within the north-northwest splays off the north-northeast trending Youanmi Fault. 660000 700000 5 E57/112 E57/112- Youanmi Gold Project E57/1387 E57/1237 Rox: 100% all metals 6840000 E57/0982 YouanmiJV Rox: 90%Au VMC:90%othermetals Prospector: 10% Au and 10% other metals 75 357 157/0642 Currans Find JV x: 90%Auand 45% othermetals VMC:45%oth Prospector: 10% Au and 10% other metals E57/098 E57/1011 PennyWest  Rox & Venus Metals Rox:100%Au VMC:100%0the \u20146800000 E57/1078 wster \u2605 E57/1  Rox Resources (100%) -Youanmi JV Rox&Venus Cumrans JV okm Figure1.Youanmi Gold ProjectLocation Plan 5 ASX CODE: RXL Level 2, 87 Colin Street, ROXRESOURCESLIMITED admin@roxresources.com.au West Perth WA 6005 www.roxresources.com.au +61 8 9226 0044 n\u533a\u56de",

EL 7423 forms a large portion of the Sofala Project, together with EL 7974.  The Sofala Project hosts inferred resources totalling 352,o00oz Au, of which 323,900 oz Au is hosted in EL 7423 at the Spring Gully Gold Project. MinRex has completed two drill programs at the Queenslander Gold Project since the farm-in. intersections including 1.0m @ 9.69 g/t Au from 74m. MinRex to enter into unincorporated joint venture with Fortuis to progress exploration on EL 7423, with MinRex as first manager.  Projects host extensive old workings that largely remain untested by modern exploration techniques. MinRex Resources Limited (Asx: MRR) (\"MinRex\" or \"the Company') is pleased to announce that it has earned a 51% interest in EL 7423 from Fortuis Mines Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Australia United Mining Limited (ASX:AYM), Project and the historic Sofala Gold Mine (refer Figure 3). Background interest in EL 7423 is a significant achievement as EL 7423 hosts gold resources totalling 323,900 oz Au (Inferred) of the EL 7423. Queenslander Gold Project The Queenslander Gold Project is centred around the historic Queenslander Gold Mine, which is approximately 2 km. south-west of the township of Sofala in central Nsw. Sofala is about 260 km north-west of Sydney and can be accessed by the Great Western Highway.The Queenslander Mine was discovered in 1888 and worked on a small scale until around 1935. The total tonnage mined was more than 7,000 tonnes from which around 3,696 oz of Au was produced at an average grade of 6 g/t of Au. The Queenslander Mine occurs within an imbricated thrust zone at the point where the Big Oakey Fault intersects the line of the Wiagdon Thrust and the thrust veers to 205 along an 025 lineament. The Wiagdon Thrust separates the Silurian Tanawarra Shale from the Sofala Volcanics.Imbricated thrust sheets under the main Wiagdon Thrust have been intruded by diorite dykes, along and adjacent to the thrust planes. The margins of the dykes are frequently associated with brecciation and shearing of the surrounding rocks, within the thrust zones. The diorite has locally been altered to clay minerals and associated with the alteration are stockworks and veinlets of quartz, carbonate, and sulphides - principally pyrite and arsenopyrite. Associated with carbonate and sulphide stockwork and veinlets is free gold and gold incorporated within the sulphide lattices. Gold also occurs disseminated within the altered diorite. The zone of imbricated thrusts is cut by a sub-vertical fault, part of the Big Oakey Fault zone,. which appears to have a variable displacement and has probably been active pre and post mineralisation.

Sealed and unsealed roads traverse most of the license area servicing predominately farming properties and the town of Trundle Active immediate regional exploration groups: CMoc/Sumitomo, Fortescue, Sunrise, Alkane, Rimfire Pacific, Magmatic and Kincora License owners Infrastructure Mineralization Township Alkane Rt FMG arge deposit Figure 9: The Trundle project is centered between potentially two long life mining projects, including Australia's second largest porphyry mine (+ Rio Tinto's recent acquisition of Platina's scandium project) The central west of Nsw is an agricultural, mining, infrastructure and rail hub. Subsequently, Kincora's approach has been to develop a detailed 3D model to advance and refine geological interpretations, to identify mineralised trends, then rank and test targets. A key advancement has been the development of this 3D working model, based upon the observed and updated geological logging, and also incorporating the structural, alteration, geochemical and mineralogical results, coupled with geophysical inversions. This significantly improved geological understanding and has both guided and justified deeper drilling. Before the 2023 phase of drilling, Kincora had completed 34 diamond holes for 23,513m with a focus in the southern portion of the license at the Trundle Park prospect with 25 holes and 16,224m (up to 1,032m depth). To date, Kincora has discovered two new porphyry intrusion areas (the Eastern and Central Zones) with associated skarn horizons, and more recently a down faulted extension to the wider system to the south - the \"Southern Extension Zone\" (\"SEZ\"). The skarn system at the Trundle Park prospect is currently believed to be one of the largest mineralised skarn. systems in Nsw, with the size of the skarn system providing significant encouragement for the size and metal tenor of the causative porphyry sources. In late 2022, Kincora announced the highest primary mineralisation to date at the Trundle project in hole TRDD032 which returned: 34m @ 1.45 g/t Au, 0.25% Cu in skarn, including an interpreted porphyry vein that. drove 2m at 19.9 g/t Au, 2.43% Cu, within a broad interval of 104m @ 0.59g/t Au and 0.11% Cu. While the interpreted porphyry vein in hole TRDD032 was less than 5 milometers width, it was very high grade, within a. 40cm semi-massive interval that drove the 19.9g/t Au and 2.43% Cu over a 2 metre sample. The newly identified and interpreted first direct porphyry vein in the SEZ provides strong evidence for potential ore grade porphyry. vein mineralisation. Prograde and retrograde skarn alteration and mineralisation have been returned in all four holes to date within the SEZ (holes TRDD029-32), with no causative porphyry intrusive source yet confirmed. Ore grade gold-copper in skarn has been intersected within the SEZ over a 330m SSE strike and 225m W-E wide system, which is open, with drilling in 2023 extending this system across a major regional fault into the Botfield prospect.

The area was explored for bauxites from 2009 to 2017 by the former Society Genie Civil Guinee SARL (Veridis Energie, 2024). The permit was relinquished due to a lack of legal activity in the field. In 2020-2022, local company Guimor SARL explored the region for gold. No further information is available. 4.5 Mineralisation The Lab\u00e9 Project is early stage and considered prospective for uranium. A historical occurrence of stratiform coffinite mineralisation (Occurrence 1 in Figure 37) was recorded in the northern part of the project (Bouffeev 2006). Also, two strong uranium anomalies were reported within the permit at Bitari and also 3 km northeast, across the Senegal border at Magnafe (Occurrences 2 and 3 in Figure 38). Lab\u00e9 is located approximately 2o km south of Haranga Resources' Saraya uranium deposit (13.1 Mt at 558 ppm U3O8 for 16.11 Mlb U30s) in Senegal (Figure 40). The uranium mineralisation at Saraya is shear type; it occurs along a north-northeast structural corridor. The mineralisation hosted by a felsic granitic batholith of Saraya is related to sodic metasomatism and episyenitisation processes (Haranga Resources, 2024). 12\u00b700W 11\u00b045:0W 11~300W N12\u00b0150W SENEGAL HARANGARESOURCES SARAYAURANIUMDEPOSIT BO 12.45Mt@587ppmeU308(16.11MIb)\uff09 DiobiEast (ASXAnnouncement25thSept23) Saraya Saraya East Saraya South HARANGA RESOURCES URANIUMANOMALIES MALI (ASXAnnouncement28Feb\u201923) OKEDOUGOU Mandankoli LABE URANIUMPROJECT GUINEA UNTESTED EXTENSIONS OF SARAYAURANIUMPROJECT ates EGCSITRF2008 5'0W 11\u00b0450\"W Figure 40: Haranga Resources' uranium occurrences around the Lab\u00e9 Project Haranga Resources is targeting south-southwest mineralisation extensions with termite mound sampling and subsequent auger/aircore drilling.

The project covers landforms and vegetation types ranging from relatively hilly areas of thick native scrub or cleared pasture, through to undulating cleared farmland! The predominant land use is for cropping of cereal and grasses, and for sheep grazing. 2.4Regional Geology The Archaean volcano-sedimentary Ravensthorpe Greenstone Belt (RGP) comprises, (from west to east, oldest to youngest), the Annabelle Volcanics (dacitic to basaltic), overlain by the Chester Formation (metasediments, including BIF) which constitute the Ravensthorpe Range. This is in turn overlain by the Bandalup Ultramafics, consisting of serpentinised peridotite, komatite, and high-Mg basalts. The Chester Formation and the Bandalup Ultramafics dominate the Carlingup Project area, typically as repeated stratigraphy due to isoclinal folding (previously interpreted as thrusting, see Lipple 2012). An aeromagnetic image of the project readily shows the ultramafic and BIF's units as linear northwest trending high ridges within more subdued zones of rock magnetism. The rocks have been intruded by Proterozoic dolerite dykes with a similar NE orientation. The greenstone sequence has undergone strong regional metamorphism.

RC drilling to commence at the Narryer Project Buxton Resources Ltd ('Buxton'; ASX:BUX) is pleased update shareholders in relation to activities at the 100% owned Graphite Bull and Narryer Projects. The ongoing drilling program at Graphite Bull aims to support a substantial Mineral Resource Estimate in Q4 2024. Recent drilling-related activities include; Diamond drilling (DD), completed 8th August with a total of 1,221.5 metres of HQ diamond core drilled across two holes. An initial batch of 57 samples from a ~52 metre length of diamond core (GB006DD 491.00 - 541.96 metres) is currently at ALS laboratories and has completed sample preparation. Total Graphitic Carbon (TGC) results are expected within two weeks. Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling has progressed smoothly, with 3,534 metres drilled across 24 holes (GB008RC - GB031RC - Table 3) averaging 146 metres depth, at 246 metres per day. Most holes have been drilled across 1,080 metres of geological strike East of the existing Resource area (Figure 1) Several new RC holes within the existing Resource aim to provide support for conversion to JORC Indicated classification. The RC drilling has intersected graphite mineralisation > 5% visually estimated TGC within 832 metres, or 24% of the metres drilled (Table 1). Results include 68 metres at >10% visually estimated TGC from 43 metres in GB012RC (see table inset on Figure 1). These new results are highly encouraging given that subparallel with ore zones), achieved an equivalent rate of 25% (1050.7 metres >5% TGC assayed across 4,149.7 metres of drilling). The current program is drilled mostly North with the aim of intersecting ore zones at an angle closer to true width. This result is interpreted to reflect generally thicker true widths of mineralisation in the East compared to the Resource area.

The Eucla Basin thickness is interpreted to be 60-100m over the Proterozoic Basement units, based on a previous passive seismic survey undertaken by the Company. The Company had previously interpreted ten priority Geophysical Targets (of which five were drill tested) at Transline from completed gravity and aeromagnetic surveys that could represent Proterozoic mafic intrusions that are. concealed beneath the Eucla Basin cover sequence. Mafic intrusions in the Fraser Range are the key host unit for nickel sulphides deposits as displayed at the IGO Nova nickel mine.

At Antoinette and Juliette bulk density values of 1.60, 1.55, 1.70, 2.00, and 2.70 t/m3 were applied to laterite, upper saprolite, lower saprolite, saprock and fresh material respectively. At Veronique bulk density values of 1.60, 1.60, 1.70, 2.10, and 2.70 t/m3 were applied to laterite, upper saprolite, lower saprolite, saprock and fresh material respectively. No allowance has been made for depletion of the Antoinette resource by artisanal mining that. affects the upper 6-8 m of parts of the deposit. Juliette and Veronique deposits are essentially unaffected by artisanal mining.. Classification General Commentary The Competent Person is satisfied that the stated Mineral Resource classification sufficiently reflects the relevant factors of the deposit.. Open pit optimisations were run using current and forecast cost, mining methods and processing parameters and a gold price of Us$2,000 to define the base of potentially economic open-pit material for the Mineral Resource. Deposit Specific Commentary Sissingue The portions of the Mineral Resource classified as Measured have been flagged using an  interpreted volume defined by high quality of estimation parameters, which includes an average distance to nearest sample of 7 m and an average distance to all informing samples of 12 m. The Measured portion of the resource has been drilled on a nominal 6 m x 8 m GC spacing. The portions of the Mineral Resource classified as Indicated have been flagged using a sectional interpreted volume defined by medium to high quality of estimation parameters, an average  distance to nearest sample of less than 20 m and an average distance to all informing samples of less than 40 m. For the sandstone and granite domains within the main Sissingue pit due consideration was also given to the geological and mineralisation continuity. The portions of the Mineral Resource classified as Inferred represent the material extending down dip within and peripheral to the mineralised Domains. In these portions geological continuity is present but not consistently confirmed by 20 m x 20 m drilling and incorporates volume extensions past the deepest drilling by up to 40 m when the domain is not closed off by drilling. The Inferred portions of the Mineral Resource are defined by low quality of estimation parameters, an average slope of regression (true to estimated block) of <0.4 and an average distance to composites used 51 ",

Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) BOARD OF DIRECTORS The Directors of Metro Mining Limited during the period and up to the date of this report were:. Name Position Douglas Ritchie Independent Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Board Simon Wensley  Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Mark Sawyer Non-Executive Director Fiona Murdoch Independent Non-Executive Director Andy Lloyd Independent Non-Executive Director PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES Metro Mining is an Australian exploration and mining company based in Brisbane, Queensland. Its flagship project, the. Bauxite Hills Mine, located 95km north of Weipa is one of the largest independent bauxite mines within the internationally acclaimed Weipa Bauxite Region. The principal activities of the Group during the period were the exploration, mining and sale of bauxite, and the brownfield expansion of the Bauxite Hills Mine. REVIEW AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 1H24 KEY HIGHLIGHTS The Group was impacted by a prolonged monsoon season that extended into May 2024 which directly translated into reduced 1H 2024 loading rates. Despite the extended wet season, Metro was able to successfully implement key expansion. assets, the Ikamba Offshore Floating Terminal (OFT) and two additional 90m barges, as well as the commissioning of the new wobbler screening circuit. With expansion assets fully on-line by the second half of June 2024, combined with Metro efforts to optimise both mining and transhipment activities, production in the second half of the 2024 year is expected to perform at a 6.5 to 7.5 M WMT pa rate in order to achieve the Group's revised shipment guidance of 6.0 to 6.4 M WMT for the year. During the half-year, the Company successfully executed a $20 million funding package, as well as completing an equity. raise with institutional and retail investors for $45 million. These funds supported the business during the extended wet. on Shareholder loans. The Company intends to continue to de-leverage the balance sheet in 2H 2024 through further debt principal repayments on Shareholder loans OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE The Group's flagship project, the Bauxite Hills Mine, located on western Cape York in Queensland, finished the half-year. with a total of 1.50 million WMT of bauxite sold The Group sold its 1H 2024 production through binding offtake agreements with customers primarily comprised of. Group General Company. All production during 1H 2024 was sold to Chinese refineries and deliveries were within contractual specifications. The Group recorded an average blended FOB and CIF sales price per tonne shipped of. A$54.28/ WMT (30 June 2023: A$49.17/ WMT).

The project benefits from substantial existing local infrastructure including sealed road access and a 75MW power station approximately 3km to the east.. The Project is situated within a structural trend orientated in a northeast-southwest direction with >3km of strike and up to 400m wide. High-grade copper mineralisation is associated with four breccia pipes The top of the Lana Corina and Vista Montana mineralised system (Figure 2) presents a series of outcropping copper bearing magmatic / hydrothermal breccias. At depth, the system transitions into a mineralised micro-tonalite which hosts consistent copper mineralisation, present mainly as chalcopyrite?. A significant zone of molybdenite mineralisation is located below the Lana Corina intrusive/breccia complex representing a magmatic cupola zone. The deeper molybdenum mineralisation is interpreted as a vertically continuous mineralised system varying in style as a result of temperature and pressure gradients.

This step-out drilling program is the first major surface drilling program completed at Dittmer and will test the significant potential for strike extensions to the old mine area, as demonstrated by the large geochemical anomaly defined in this area and the presence of high-grade Golden Gem -- 278g/t Au) but have never been drill tested, much like Dittmer. This initial program is planned to confirm the existence of an extension to the Duffer Lode structure as well as other structures in the local area at a broad initial spacing. A small footprint drill rig has been employed to complete this program and complete a series of shallow diamond holes to test the target on a broad spacing. The initial surface drill program is envisaged to comprise eight holes for 1,oo0m. Pending success of this program, a major follow-up program will be undertaken.

Planned drilling at Cedar Ridge prospect The Dittmer Project hosts a range of vein-hosted, breccia-hosted, skarn-hosted and porphyry-style deposits dominated with copper, gold, silver and other base and critical minerals. During the quarter, plans were advanced to undertake an initial RC drilling program at the Cedar Ridge prospect, located 20km south of the Dittmer mine. This target hosts an extensive zone of gold-bearing quartz veining with associated geochemical anomaly that remains untested by drilling. The target is interpreted to represent a deeper part of the same mineralised system that hosts the higher-level Dittmer bonanza quartz lodes. Drilling is currently expected to commence in Q3 2024. ",

The project is situated on the Archean Preissac Lacorne batholith, a syn-to post-tectonic intrusion that was emplaced in the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt of the Superior Province of Quebec. To the north the batholith is bounded by the Manneville Fault and to the south by the Cadillac Fault and the eastward extension of the Porcupine Destor Fault. The batholith, which is a composite body has associated pegmatites and quartz veins. The Company completed its regional first pass MMl soil survey on a 400m x 400m grid during the 494 ppb Li. This sample also had notable values of Rb (810 ppb) and Cs (52.1 ppb), and other samples south of this one had anomalous values in Cs (64.8 ppb) and Ta (17 ppb); helping to define a prospective 2.5 km long northerly trend for Lithium-bearing pegmatite. Similarly, a sample towards the east side of. the East Block also had a very notable 345 ppb Li, within a northeast-southwest striking 4.5 km trend that Infini Resources Limited ABN 77 656 098 583 www.infiniresources.com.au XInfiniResources 8 ",

The mineralisation is contained within a hydrothermally altered peralkaline granite porphyry dyke.The ScD is up to 6Om thick and can be traced E-W for over 7kms along strike (Figure 6). The SCD generally dips steeply to the north (~60), with gold mineralisation extending down dip for at least 1km and it is open at depth..

Geology of the Sams Creek deposit. The porphyry dyke is variably mineralised and has been modified by at least four alteration / mineralisation stages. The granite and Iamprophyre dykes and mineralisation suggests the hydrothermal fluids were sourced from the crystallisation of a granite magma or associated underlying magma chamber. The high sulphide content and alteration mineralogy resembles alkaline intrusive related Cu- Mo-Au deposits. Lidar topography analysis shows two distinct circular structures at Sams Creek with the north dipping scD located around the southern margins of both structures (Figure 7). The Main Zone circular structure and the Anvil Zone circular structure are around 2.0kms and 1.3kms wide respectively. Two potential buried intrusions, interpreted by Southern Geoscience Consultants, fall within the circular structures, as shown in Figure 7. The lonic Leach soil geochemistry survey was recently extended over the majority of the Main and Anvil Zone circular structures. IL geochemistry is a proprietary partial leach soil assay technique available from ALS Geochemistry. The method has a deep sensing capability that can be used to identify buried or blind mineral systems that host metal deposits, using their fingerprints at surface to complement other techniques (i.e. geophysics), allowing better drillhole positioning. The Main Zone circular structure is only partially covered by the IL survey. The gold map (Figure 7A) shows a very strong anomaly in the SE segment associated with the Main Zone resource of 824koz @ 2.8g/t Au (see ASX Announcement dated 21 August 2023) and the remainder of the outcropping ScD where sampled.

For the toll treatment option, the NPV has potential to grow from the base A$ 38 M. to A$ 48 - 99 M, and the gold production has potential to increase from 55 koz to 69 - 80 koz. For the owner plant scenarios, the NPV could potentially grow from the base A$ 42 M to A$ 62 - 121 M, and the gold production could potentially increase from 89 koz to 111 - 116 koz.. This significant upside potential if the project can be grown in scale is the motivator for the ongoing. drilling, which will bring another iteration of an update to the resource model and updates to pit optimisation and mining schedules. While this scale upside remains, the choice of the best project pathway to take forward to feasibility study and detailed design is difficult, the results of the next round of drilling will assist in refining the strategy further. It is recommended that studies into the Steam Engine Gold Project continue - progressing both the toll treatment and owner plant options until such time as a decision between the two pathways can be made, which may not be until the scale of the project is able to be better quantified. Financial evaluation shows the project to have a positive and robust NPv through both options with the current assumptions used. August 2024 Page 9 ",

Critical minerals and base metals explorer IItani Resources Limited (Asx: ILT, \"lltani\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to announce it has commenced drilling a deep diamond hole at its Orient silver- Iead-zinc-indium project in northern Queensland, the deepest hole drilled to date at the project. HIGHLIGHTS: Orient deep diamond hole (to ~750m vertical depth) will test a large-scale geophysical anomaly. Iocated beneath the Orient West silver-lead-zinc-indium mineralised system.  Iltani will also conduct a Downhole Electromagnetic (DHEM) survey on completion of the deep diamond drill hole.. The drilling and DHEM survey are supported by a $299,000 grant awarded to Iltani through Round 8 of the Collaborative Exploration Initiative (CEl) under the Queensland Department of Resources' Industry Development Plan..  The CEl is designed to directly support innovative exploration activities aimed at the discovery. of critical minerals in Queensland. The grant provides strong validation by the Queensland Department of Resources for the Orient Project and the work undertaken to date by Iltani to develop the Company's silver-indium discovery..  Results are pending for the remaining 10 reverse circulation drill holes completed at Orient West. in May 2024. Iltani Managing Director Donald Garner commented:. \"We have started drilling the Orient deep diamond hole, and this marks an exciting step for lltani. The. diamond drill hole will be the deepest hole ever drilled at Orient and will seek to confirm the potential. for a porphyry system at depth.. When the hole is completed, we will undertake a DHEM survey and this will enable Iltani to bette understand the architecture of the Orient system, in particular the source of mineralising fluids and. potential larger accumulations of mineralisation (copper and/or tin) associated with the porphyry at. depth. We expect the hole to take around 25 days to reach target depth and we cannot wait to see what is down there. Meanwhile the results from our 10-hole reverse circulation program completed at Orient West in May are expected very soon, and we expect these will further build on our understanding of the grade and. scale of the Orient system.\" www.iltaniresources.com.au Page 1 of 4 ",

        "text": "REACH ASX RR1 RESOURCES ASX ANNOUNCEMENT During sampling an exposure of granitic pegmatite was uncovered and sampled (24wRck046 and 24WRck049), which has resulted in assays with similarly high grades of niobium, REE and titanium to. those of the surface eluvium previously sampled. A summary of significant results is provided in Table 1 and a full set of assay results is provided in Appendix A. Reach CEO, Jeremy Bower commented: \"This is a significant breakthrough for the Wabli Creek project. It was not known whether the hard rock source material would hold the same or similar concentrations as the previously reported surface eluvium samples, however taking rock chips directly from the hard rock in- situ material and returning similar grades up to 17% Nb2Os, plus high grade REE and Titanium is extremely. promising. The recent identification ofthe late stage intrusive bySouthern Geoscience showing the margins coincident with the geochemical targets adds weight to the theory we may have more high-grade material to discover. Initial geochemistry indicates that the late stage intrusive has an alkali signature and is on the same.. continuum as a carbonatite, so further work is planned to investigate whether we also have a carbonatite source in addition to these rare earth pegmatites. We have now engaged Southern Geoscience to interpret NOTE: Tenements E09/2377 (Wabli Creek) and E09/2748 (Wabli Creek North) together comprise the Company's Wabli Creek Project area, however, samples were only taken from Wabli Creek during this. program. Next Steps: Southern Geoscience to complete interpretation of detailed radiometric, gravity and magnetic data from an airborne geophysical survey over the project area.

        "text": "GOLDENMILE RESOURCES Arizona is a Tier 1 mining jurisdiction, and the UsA's top copper producing state. It is also an established and attractive mining jurisdiction, ranking No. 7 in 2023's Investment Attractiveness Index by the Fraser Institute. It is supported by world class infrastructure which includes sealed roads and railways, mains power transmission lines, with access to a highly skilled workforce. Arizona is host to some of the world's largest copper discoveries. Project Geology Within the Project area, porphyry copper prospective, Laramide age igneous rocks, situated immediately north of San-Manuel-Kalamazoo, have been identified. Geological mapping has also. identified propylitic alteration and fault architecture similar to the San-Manuel-Kalamazoo deposit. The Project area exhibits widespread mineralisation associated with epithermal veins, including the historic Pearl mine with visible copper mineralisation over more than 800 metres at surface. Propylitic alteration observed in the area suggests significant exploration potential for the presence of an. underlying porphyry hydrothermal system. At the Project, the basement (Proterozoic) rocks are locally overprinted by propylitic (chlorite-epidote carbonate) alteration, which is a common feature in distal porphyry hydrothermal systems. The propylitic alteration occurs in several areas along a Nw-sE trending zone roughly parallel to the San Manuel fault that bisects the + 1 billion tonne San Manuel-Kalamazoo orebody. Chlorite-epidote-carbonate  silica-sericite (propylitic) alteration occurs within this Nw-sE trending zone and has been interpreted as related to the circulation of hydrothermal fluid. Regional mapping conducted by Outcrop also identified porphyry dykes which have been dated as coinciding in age, with the reported timing of formation of the San Manuel-Kalamazoo copper deposit. (approximately 68 Ma8). Mineralisation Numerous historic workings within the project area relate to Nw to Nnw trending mineralised structures, hosting quartz veins with disseminated pyrite, galena, and copper oxide mineralisation. Immediately to the east of the tenement (600m) is the Tiger Mines area, which produced over 400,000 ounces of gold, 1 million ounces of silver, 6 million pounds of molybdenum oxide, 2.5 million pounds of vanadium pentoxide, 70 million pounds of lead, and 50 million pounds of zinc. This polymetallic mineralisation is hosted in faults trending Nw to NNw. The most significant workings within the Project area are the Pearl and Ford Mines. The Pearl Mine is Iocated on the north-western portion of the Project. It produced up to 60,o00 tons of ore containing copper oxide and sulphide, lead, silver, and gold from 1915 to 1941 (Force, 1997). The structural trend of the mineralisation is Nw-NNW with lines made by historic workings to the north and south along this strike direction.

Target Area 1 is only 700m from the nearest historical mining and 1km along strike of the Mauretania prospect where Emmerson returned best drill result of 20m @ 38.5g/t Au in a diamond drill hole. Also, within this trend, only 3oom north of Mauretania, there has been historical mining on a quartz hematite lode.. Drilling at Langrenus focused on Target Area 1 and 2 (Figure 3) with a significant quartz hematite zone intersected in Area 1 - where 2023 IP work identified an EW trending chargeability zone that intersects the main NW gravity anomaly. The overall zone is 20m down hole thickness with varying intensity of quartz. veining and hematite in iron altered Warramunga siltstone units. This new intersection gives KRR a strong structural target along strike of the complex ironstone and mineralised zone that hosts Mauretania Hopeful Star and the historical quartz hematite mining. Further work is being planned to test the orientation and extents of this new quartz hematite zone.. Drilling at Target Area 2 intersected broad zones of hematite alteration and veining, including a quartz magnetite vein.

Gold mineralisation is controlled by cross-cutting structures across lithological contacts of the mafic units and adjacent felsic volcaniclastics. Porphyry intrusions are commonly associated with the gold at Cardinia Hill and Rangoon. Structures appear to be stockwork in nature, with steeply dipping east and west orientations as well as flat to moderate conjugates. The ore zones are associated with increased shearing and intense sericite/carbonate alteration and disseminated sulphides. Volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VHms) mineralisation was discovered in 2023, at the Albus prospect in IP22DD001, as part of a broader VHMS fertility exercise. This mineralisation has been logged as sphalerite-dominated massive sulphides with subordinate chalcopyrite, pyrite and galena, with the zone sitting within cherty sediments along a contact of basalt and felsic volcaniclastics from 270.3 m downhole; a typical VHMs host setting. Continued geochemistry and mapping have confirmed the presence of both VHMS and gold as separate mineral systems. overprinting and remobilising VHMS mineralisation, which has followed the pre-existing structures from a period of extension, which now exist as steep N-S oriented shear zones. 2024 diamond drilling In April 2024, KIN completed a five hole, 2498.8 m diamond drilling program targeting both base metal and gold mineralisation within the Cardina Gold Project. Three of the holes preliminary results confirming the potential for an economic base metal discovery. The result opened significant exploration opportunity both along strike and in parallel horizons.

This project area is considered highly prospective for gold, copper, lead, zinc and rare earth elements.. Terramin's South Gawler Ranges Project is located along the southern margin of the Gawler Ranges, northern Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. The project comprises a group of eleven Exploration Licenses totaling 4,524km2. Adelaide Hills Project No significant exploration activity has been undertaken during the quarter outside those activities detailed in this report in respect of the BlHGP and the Kapunda In Situ Copper Recovery Project.. South Gawler Ranges Project (SGRP) (Exploration Agreement with Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security (JOGMEC)) In March 2022, Terramin entered into a $10.5 million agreement with JOGMEC for exploration of the SGRP. The agreement was subsequently given FIRB approval in June 2022. To date, JOGMEC has expended in excess of $1.5 million under the agreement and has earned a 30% interest option in the SGRP tenements. During the quarter, JOGMEC and Terramin have been developing an exploration drilling program focusing for the drill sites was previously obtained and the proposed drilling has been recently approved by DEM. Drilling is expected to commence in early October.. The exploration drilling program comprises three diamond drillholes:. MD131 located on EL 5949 (Menninnie Dam) approximately 2km south-southeast of the. Menninnie Central Ag-Pb-Zn deposit, and 600 metres south-southeast of the Viper Ag-Pb-Zn lodes. It is anticipated that this drillhole will be drilled to a depth of approximately 1o00 metres. It is. targeting skarn-hosted Cu/Au mineralisation.. BC3E01 located on EL 6413 (Kolendo), targeting coincident gravity and EM anomalies that  potentially host Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOcG) mineralisation. BC3E01 will be drilled to a depth of. approximately 800 metres. BC1s01 located on EL 6412 (Mt Ive South) to test for IOcG mineralisation in dense conductive rocks beneath an epithermal quartz-hematite vein array.

The morphology of the anomalism indicates that Tiptoe may have an additional north-northeast south-southwest structure intersecting the major northeast southwest structure. This is highly encouraging for Carnavale as the intersection of these structures may provide dilationary sites amenable to bonanza gold accumulations. Previous drilling at Tiptoe intersected high-grade gold within fresh rock that included 1m @ 20.3g/t in  MERC118. Carnavale will follow this up with further RC to test the extents of this high-grade intersection. The reported during the quarter included: Ora Banda Gold Project Ghan Dam During the period, Carnavale completed a small exploratory program of aircore drilling at the Ghan Dam Prospect in the southwestern area of the Project targeting strike extensions to previous anomalies outlined in the previous aircore drilling in the regolith. Exploration consisted of 14 aircore holes for 800m program at the Ghan Dam Prospect within the Ora Banda Gold Project. All holes reached target depth and were completed in fresh rock.. Anomalous gold and pathfinder results were mainly received from the top of fresh rock interface. Best results. from the program included:  OBAC449 - 1m @ 0.16g/t from 48m The anomalous gold results are coincident with a moderate tellurium (maximum values of 0.72ppm tellurium) and low-level arsenic (maximum values of 33.7ppm arsenic) anomaly, which tracks the contacts and occurrences of the felsic porphyries intersected by the drilling. Carnavale has already identified the Carnage prospect and Highlander prospect within the Project as host to extensive kilometre scale gold anomalies in the regolith. The Project contains favourable geology with the potential to host a significant gold deposit, with major shear. in aircore. with the best gold anomalism suggesting an intrusion related source for the gold system. 12 Level 2, 389 Oxford Street, Mount Hawthorn, Western Australia 6016 | PO Box 281 Mount Hawthorn WA 6915.

        "text": "ASKARI QUARTERLY REPORT ASX:AS2 Red Peak Project, WA. Askari announced assay results from an auger drilling campaign at its Red Peak project in the Gascoyne Region of Western Australia.. A total of 801 auger drilling samples were collected on the Red Peak project on a 500m x 500m grid with both \"light\" and \"heavy\" Rare Earth Element groups.. The Red Peak project is southeast of the Mt Clere REE-Niobium project owned by Krakatoa Resources Limited (ASx. KTA), sharing the same geological features and settings and boasting the same mineralisation potential.. Auger drilling aimed to test the potential of the Red Peak project at a project-wide level with a 500m x 500m sample spacing. The location of the samples were selected based on field activities undertaken by the Company during previous exploration campaigns as well as Rare Earth Element results from the WAME database. In addition, the Company utilised the target generation survey identified by ASTER satellite hyperspectral analysis. Results from this initial auger drilling campaign has demonstrated the significant exploration upside at the Red Peak project for \"light\" and \"heavy\" REE mineralisation as well as the potential for identifying project. The Company plans to follow up this project-wide campaign with a 250m x 250m infill auger drilling grid. The assay analysis covered the full suite of Rare Earth Elements (REE), and the data was reviewed with Rare Earth Oxides (THREO). Significantly, these assay results demonstrate that 381 samples have TREO results above the nominal background value of 255 ppm TREO, and they also show that Light REOs are more prevalent in the data than Heavy REOs, although both are extremely anomalous.. Future work The results of this initial project-wide auger drilling and sampling campaign have enabled the Company will help define the Rare Earth Element target more clearly.. A proposed infill program is planned to be 250m x 250m and should include a further 635 samples. The Board will determine the commencement of this program depending on the Company's overall exploration strategy ACN 646 034 460 I askarimetals.com Page 12 ",

No work was completed during the  quarter. Uley North Project, Eyre Peninsula SA (Graphite) Westar entered into a 3-month Option Agreement with a private vendor to acquire the highly prospective Uley North Graphite Project, located near Port Lincoln on the southern Eyre Peninsula SA (Figure 4). Highlights:  The Project comprises two tenements totaling 163km within the Hutchison Group, directly bordering extensions of Quantum Graphite's Uley Graphite Mine (on care & maintenance), which boasts Australia's highest-grade flake graphite resource of 7.2Mt at 10.5% Total Graphitic Carbon ('TGC')..  Located 100km southwest along strike from Renascor's Siviour Graphite Deposit (93.5Mt at 7.3% TGC) - the world's 2nd largest Proven Graphite Reserve, which is now nearing development.  Historic drill intersections on the Uley North Project revealed promising results, including up to 8m at 5.1% TGC within a broader zone of 38m at 2.1% TGC with undrilled EM anomalies along strike.  There is an electromagnetic (EM) anomaly located along strike from the Uley Graphite Mine..  Historic rock chip assays up to 35% TGC, and up to 10km strike of aeromagnetic anomalies which could represent a fertile host rock unit, offer additional quality exploration targets. Westar visited the project area in order to improve the Company's understanding of the geology, key stakeholders, land access, infrastructure, logistics, evaluate the potential for graphite mineralisation, and. integrate insights from historical data to refine exploration targets. During the field trip it was observed that the majority of the Project area is covered by sandy soil or gravel, with very little outcrop. Conducting an airborne geophysical survey is an effective approach for exploring. large areas with minimal previous exploration, particularly using the electromagnetic technique to discover an AEM survey; focusing on select areas of Uley North that are most likely to host graphite mineralisation.. Timing of the survey is dependent on successful completion of due diligence and securing relevant approvals. In the interim, Resource Potentials are completing a detailed geophysical report on the project. All historical exploration data was compiled during the quarter and integrated into a database. A detailed geological report was also well advanced as were due diligence reports.. Next Steps The findings of the due diligence reports will determine if Westar proceeds with exercising the Option. Agreement and acquire the Uley North Graphite Project. ",

Both were mined by open pit between. 1999 and 2001. 1990-1995- Plutonic Resources exploration division carried out exploration on the Freshwater tenements. and discovered a total of 1 underground and 30 surface prospects. Follow up resource definition drilling resulted in conversion of these prospects to 10 open pits and one underground mine, including Area 4 1999-2004 - Homestake Gold of Australia undertook a detailed aeromagnetic and radiometric survey over the entire lease area. Additional IP and moving loop geophysical surveys were undertaken between 2000 and 2004 across several prospects. The largest of which was across the K1-K2 project area in 2004. 2004 - the Plutonic Development department undertook a large soil sampling programme over the northwestern end of the Marymia tenements, in conjunction with the IP survey. These surveys identified a number of targets that were followed up with some additional surface geochemical sampling. 2001-2007 - exploration and resource definition drilling by RAB, RC and diamond core drilling was undertaken by the Plutonic Development department across numerous prospects outside of the Plutonic Mine area. Many of these drilled prospects were proven up to become small satellite open pit mines such as Triple P B-Zone, Albatross, Flamingo, Kookaburra, Ibis, Piranha, to name a few. 2009-2012 - RC and diamond core drilling concentrated on extensions to the known Plutonic deposit. Outside of this area two 2D seismic lines were shot in conjunction with Curtin University and diamond. core drill was undertaken at Plutonic West and Cod prospects.. 3.Sampling and Sub-Sampling Techniques. Exploration DD core is sawn in half along the orientation lines, with half the sample being submitted for assay and the remaining half being retained for reference. Grade control DD core is whole core sampled. and sent for analysis. DD core samples were taken at 1 m intervals or at geological boundaries. RC samples were collected for each metre drilled and passed through a cyclone and riffle splitter to produce a two kg to four kg assay into calico bags.. Rock chip FS are completed by the mine geologists. The sampling is taken by chipping the face into calico bags with definition by lithological boundaries. FS samples are taken perpendicular to the lode orientation in the face. The face sample locations are marked up and measured from fixed survey points. DD recovery is not noted specifically, though the core is jig sawed back together, and meter marked carefully. Discrepancies to core blocks are brought up with the drill contractor. Occasionally core loss blocks are inserted. Overall drill core recovery is very high due to the competent nature of the ground. Rock chip FS recoveries are not relevant in this instance.. 4. Historical Sampling The Plutonic Gold Mine has been in operation since 1990 following discovery in 1988. QAQC procedures. have changed throughout that period. The current underground Mineral Resources have been identified over a long period of time with a number of companies. All high confidence Mineral Resources are based dominantly on underground DD and FS completed in the last 14 years. Drilling and sampling techniques by previous operators is assumed to be to industry standard at that time. 5.Sample Analysis Method In recent years, for DD and FS, gold concentration is determined by fire assay using the lead collection ASX:CYL catalystmetals.com.au ",

The company intends to fund the proposed work, scheduled for the upcoming field season of September. to November, by the concurrently announced capital raise.. The Company's Competent Person, Mr Ralf Kriege, states that the information in this announcement is an accurate representation of the available data for the Bronze Fox Project.. The grade and tonnage estimates constituting the Mineral Resource and Exploration Target were determined using a block model based on historic drilling. The Exploration Target comprises potential mineralisation below the current Mineral Resource from approximately 325m below surface to over 1,200m below surface. Preliminary metallurgical recovery analysis at Xanadu Mines Ltd geologically similar Kharmagtai deposit has indicated recoveries of 90% Cu and 78% Au. These assumed recoveries, together with conservative metal prices (Cu at UsD$3.40/pound and Au at UsD$1400/ounce), were used to calculated copper equivalents (CuEq) for each resource model block from the estimated Cu and Au grades. The Mineral Resource is reported above a 0.2% CuEq cut-off. Upcoming exploration Woomera will be conducting a site visit in August to assess and verify planned drill sites and organise the logistics of the upcoming work program. This is expected to include a comprehensive mapping and sampling programme paired with a drilling campaign aimed at further evaluating the mineral potential at depth and along strike.

Several NwN trending faults with cross cutting WNw structures are. present in the Project area. These faults and structures have acted as hydrothermal fluid flow loci for the mineralisation, and deposited copper where physio-chemical conditions allow. Mineralised zones are interpreted to be from 20m wide along the NwN trending faults and potentially up to 200m wide along the cross-cutting WNw trending structures. Mineralised zones are associated with fractured and. brecciated rocks, with carbonate-epidote and chlorite the common alteration products. Observed. copper minerals at Rosario comprise copper oxides, such as malachite and chrysocolla. At deeper. levels beneath the weathered zone, copper sulphide minerals would be anticipated. The El Salvador porphyry copper deposit is located approximately 1Okm south of the Rosario Project - see Figure 4 below. The mineralised porphyries at El Salvador intrude the same rocks that host. mineralisation at Rosario. It is unknown if there is any genetic link between the Rosario mineralisation and the El Salvador mineralisation. Some minor, unmineralised porphyry intrusives are present in the Project area, and potential for blind porphyry copper targets beneath Rosario cannot be discounted.

Criteria Commentary Sampling techniques All data presented herein are from past exploration activities prior to Westar involvement and have been obtained from open file public records dating from 1914 to 2012.. Samples are all from early-stage exploration work comprising surface soil and rock and trench. samples, as well as rotary air blast (RAB), Aircore (AC), reverse circulation percussion (RC) and diamond core (DDH) drilling. For early-stage exploration projects the quality of past data is considered fit for purpose. All references to mineralisation are taken from reports and documents prepared by previous explorers and have been reviewed by Westar and considered to be fit for purpose. All data presented herein are historical and Westar is undertaking a full validation of the nature and quality of the sampling completed.. Drilling techniques Various drill types have been used previously including aircore (AC), rotary air blast (RAB), reverse circulation percussion (RC) and diamond coring (DDH). At this time, hole diameters and detailed information regarding drilling has not been compiled and for early-stage exploration projects the quality of past data is considered fit for purpose. Drill sample recovery Westar is undertaking validation of the data to determine whether this information has been collected in full. Only limited data is available in the open file reports addressing these criteria However, for early-stage grass roots exploration projects, the absence of this information is not considered material. Logging All holes were geologically logged to varying degrees of detail. Westar is undertaking verification of the quality and level of detail of the geological logging data. Sub-sampling It is believed that core has been cut and sampled according to industry standard (half core) techniques and sample Various sampling methods have been employed previously for non-core drilling. As discussed. preparation above, the absence of detailed information on this criteria is not considered material to an assessment of early-stage exploration potential.. Quality of assay data  The sample preparation and assay method used is considered standard industry practice and is and laboratory tests appropriate for the style of the deposits.. None of the previous reports that have been reviewed by Westar to date specified the use o1 any spectrometers or handheld XRF tools. As discussed above, the absence of detailed information on these criteria is not considered material to an assessment of early-stage exploration potential and planning exploration activities. ",

Deeper drilling beneath and adjacent to the significant intervals, and direct testing. of TargetEM anomalies expected in 2025. Gold and base metals explorer Carawine Resources Limited (Carawine or the Company) (ASx: Cwx) is. pleased to announce assay results from shallow RC drilling at the Cable tenement, returning several significant copper and gold intervals from both the Warroo North and Waroo NE prospects, and identifying. Cable is part of the Company's Paterson Copper-Gold Project, located in the Paterson Province of Western Australia, where Carawine is targeting polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMs) deposits in Archaean Hardey Formation volcanics (Figure 3).. The results announced today are from a 312-hole program completed in July 2024, designed as an initial test of the \"Waroo\" prospects defined by Carawine from historic exploration data (Figure 1) (refer to ASX. announcements 18 October 2022 and 1 July 2024). Commenting on the results, Carawine Managing Director David Boyd said: \"We consider today's results to be highly encouraging, with a number of significant copper and gold intervals returned, and large areas of copper and zinc anomalism identified, from just our first drilling. program at Cable. This is especially exciting because the drilling was shallow in this initial first-pass program, reaching no more than 13 metres below surface in most holes.\" \"Combined with the results of our helicopter-borne electromagnetic TargetEM survey, and the historic exploration data, we expect the results of this drilling to yield several high potential, high priority targets for deeper direct drill testing expected to occur in 2025.\" 1 \"significant\" intervals defined as >=0.3% Cu or >=0.1g/t Au, \"anomalous\" intervals defined as >= 0.1% Cu, or >= 0.1% Zn, or = O.01ppm Au, over >=1m width with <=2m internal waste; down hole widths; includes 4m composite samples, \"eoh\" = end of hole; refer to Table 1 and Appendix 1 for details. 2 \"TargetEM\" helicopter-borne electromagnetic survey; refer ASX announcement 1 July 2024 info@carawine.com.au L1/18 Kings Park Rd, West Perth WA 6005 | P0 Box 543,West Perth WA 6872 | T +61 (08)9209 2703 www.carawine.com.au ",

Highlights The latest rock chip assays identify a significant third parallel copper-bearing. gossan extending the eastern extent of the Baratta Copper Project. New high-grade infill rock chip assays up to 22% copper reinforce the consistency of copper-grade along the mapped 3.6 kilometres strike of multiple. stacked copper-rich gossans.. Ongoing exploration work includes geological mapping, sampling, geophysical re-processing and petrological examination of primary sulphide-bearing breccias from Baratta mine waste.. Baratta's geological setting displays characteristics Stelar considers similar to. those seen in the Central African Copper Belt, the world's second-largest copper-producing province. Stelar Metals Limited (ASX:SLB) (\"Stelar Metals\" or \"the Company\") has identified a third parallel copper mineralised gossan to the east of the Baratta Copper Project. Additionally, infill rock chips also emphasise the consistency of the high-grade copper grades along the strike of the stacked stratabound gossans (Figure 1). Baratta is considered highly prospective consistent for Sediment-hosted Stratabound Copper (SSC) mineralisation analogous to the Central African Copper Belt (CACB). The Baratta Copper Project has now been mapped and sampled for over 3.6 km along strike, which remains open in both directions.

About Sunday Creek. The Sunday Creek epizonal-style gold project is located 60 km north of Melbourne within 19,365 hectares of granted exploration tenements. SxG is also the freehold landholder of 133.29 hectares that form the key Gold and antimony form in a relay of vein sets that cut across a steeply dipping zone of intensely altered rocks mineralised vein sets are the rungs that extend from surface to depth. At Apollo and Rising Sun these individual 'rungs' have been defined over 600 m depth extent from surface to 1,100 m below surface, are 2.5 to 3.5 m wide (up to 10 m), and 20 m to 100 m in strike. Cumulatively, 131 drill holes for 58,494 m have been reported by SXG (and Mawson Gold Ltd) from Sunday Creek since late 2020. An additional 10 holes for 439 m from Sunday Creek were abandoned due to deviation or hole conditions. Fourteen drillholes for 2,383 m have been reported regionally outside of the main Sunday Creek drill area. A total of 64 historic drill holes for 5,599 m were completed from the late 1960s to 2008. The project now contains a total of forty-five (45) >100 g/t AuEq x m and fifty (50) >50 to 100 g/t Au x m drill holes by applying a 2 m @ 1 g/t lower cut. Our systematic drill program is strategically targeting these significant vein formations, initially these have been defined over 1,350 m strike of the host from Christina to Apollo prospects, of which approximately 620 m has been more intensively drill tested (Rising Sun to Apollo). At least 50 'rungs' have been defined to date. Geologically, the project is located within the Melbourne Structural Zone in the Lachlan Fold Belt. The regional host to the Sunday Creek mineralisation is an interbedded turbidite sequence of siltstones and minor sandstones metamorphosed to sub-greenschist facies and folded into a set of open north-west trending folds. Further Information. Further discussion and analysis of the Sunday Creek project is available through the interactive Vrify 3D animations, presentations and videos all available on the SxG website.

Itiquira has the same tectonic setting and geological and geophysical attributes. as other REE and Niobium mineralised intrusions in Central and Southeast Brazil. The reconnaissance program will have a focussed exploration team at the Itiquira Project undertaking mapping and sampling to be followed with shallow scout. auger drilling The program is the third exploration program to commence and run concurrently. with the recent launches of the Caladao and Caldas drill programs. Axel REE Limited (Asx: AXL, \"Axel\" or \"the Company') is pleased to announce the commencement of a geological reconnaissance and scouting program at its 1o0% owned, highly prospective and unexplored Itiquira Project (Itiquira).Itiquira is located in the southeast portion of the State of Mato Grosso, in the central-west portion of Brazil. Axel's Itiquira Project has 396km? of granted exploration permits covering a significant portion of the Itiquira Complex. Itiquira is interpreted to be an Alkaline Igneous Complex, associated with the Transbrasiliano Lineament. This deep transcontinental structure, together with the 125 AZ Lineament, controlled the ascent and emplacement of mantle-derived magmas during the Cretaceous. Intrusive complexes controlled by these structures include the Araxa and Catalao Carbonatitic Complexes, which contain world class niobium and phosphate mines. Brazilian niobium deposits are of global significance, accounting for 97% of the world's supply of niobium. concentrate. The Araxa niobium mine is owned by CBMm, the world's largest niobium producer and accounts for approximately 80% of global supply'. Catalao is owned by CMOC and is the second largest niobium producer in the world?. Another significant Alkaline Complex is the Pogos de Caldas Alkaline. Complex where Axel has recently announced the commencement of an auger drill program amongst neighbouring companies Meteoric Resources NL and Viridis Mining and Minerals Limited's world class high grade REE Resources3. The Itiquira Project combines several geological, geophysical, and geotechnical attributes that underscore its high niobium prospectivity.

The fair value less cost of disposal, is used to assess the recoverable value of the CGU. The mine properties noted above. and the property, plant and equipment that is an intrinsic part of the mine and its structure (included in note 20) are included in determining the carrying value of the CGU, which has been estimated at US$19,833 thousand after considering working  capital, for the purposes of assessing for impairment, while the carrying value of the Guanaco/ Amancaya mine properties, plant and equipment is US$38,392 thousand. Management have assessed the recoverable value to be above book value of the Guanaco/Amancaya project and therefore Property, plant and equipment (note 20). An impairment test was also performed internally using the discounted cash flow model (DCF) as the primary valuation methodology. This FVLCOD discounted cashflow model is a level 3 fair value hierarchy. Main assumptions of the DCF model for impairment test purposes are as follows:. : Forecast Gold price (2024-2033): US$2,450/oz-2,200/oz, with a weighted average of US$2,243/oz (31 December 2023 (2024- 2033): US$2,048/oz - US$1,815/oz)  Forecast Silver price (2024-2033):US$29/oz-28/oz (31 December 2023 (2024-2033) US$24/oz- US$25/oz - The gold and silver assumptions represent management's assessment of future prices are based on current commodity  prices and market expectations of future changes Life of mine operations based on the current model are forecast to end in 2033 (31 December 2023:2033) Discount Rate (pre-tax): 9.6% (31 December 2023: 9.6%) - Discount Rate (after-tax): 8.5% (31 December 2023: 8.5%) - The discount rate was a measure estimated based on the Company's current weighted average cost of capital.. : Production costs 2024 (US$1,364) 2023 (US$1,645/oz) - Production costs are management's estimate of costs based on estimated production, historical data and anticipated.  inflationary changes Production is based on Proven and Probable reserves and resource estimates to 31 December 2023 that are based on an  independent technical report provided to the Group in 2022. No reasonably possible change to the key assumptions would. result in a recoverable value below the book value of any of the projects. The sensitivities to the key assumptions would have. the following results; The sensitivity to +/- 10% variation in the gold price (Us$2,018-Us$2,467/oz) on the recoverable value of the Guanaco/  Amancaya project results in an impact of +/- US$19,000 thousand.

Notably, the largely untested airborne electromagnetic (AEM) anomaly target that will be a focus of Havilah's future drilling at Mutooroo lies at depth beneath this drillhole (Figure 2). Accordingly, it is The above drilling intersections are at depths shallower than 150 metres that are potentially exploitable by open pit mining methods and support Havilah's original objective of expanding the shallow open pit mineral resources. JX Advanced Metals Corporation (JXAM) Study Program Following signing of the binding MOU with JXAM (refer to AsX announcement of 19 August 2024), Havilah has completed 8 precollar RC drillholes to depths of up to 189 metres with its RC drilling rig. This is in preparation for a. contractor diamond drilling rig that will extend these drillholes a short distance through the underlying sulphide mineralisation to obtain samples for metallurgical testwork. By drilling the precollar holes with its Rc drilling rig Havilah is effectively saving time (diamond drilling is typically significantly slower than RC drilling) and money is meeting the costs associated with the Mutooroo study program, including the RC precollar and diamond drilling In conjunction with collection of suitable metallurgical samples and some twinned drillholes for verification purposes, Havilah will continue drilling RC precollar drillholes over the next few weeks until it effectively completes the next tier of resource upgrade and resource extension drillholes at depths of roughly 150 - 200 metres below surface (largely within the grey shaded area shown in Figure 2).

In May 2022, Miramar completed an Offset Pole-Dipole IP survey which highlighted a chargeability anomaly offset approximately 400m to the northeast from the 8 Mile Dam IP anomaly and beneath several aircore holes which retumed end of hole (EOH) results >2g/t Au.  In early 2024, the Company completed an additional Offset Pole-Dipole IP survey north of the 2022 survey lines. The new survey also comprised a central transmitter line and two receiver lines spaced approximately 400m apart along strike.. Together, the two IP surveys have outlined an IP chargeability anomaly over a strike length of approximately 1.1km with a shallower anomaly at the northern end of the survey and beneath aircore hole GJAC288, which ended in 1.21g/t Au.. The Company plans to refine the IP anomaly before drill testing.. GLANDORE The 100%-owned Glandore Project is located within the Eastern Goldfields, approximately 40km east of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia and covers approximately 42 square km. The project consists of 10 Prospecting Licences.. The highest priority western part of the project is underlain by a layered mafic sill intruding into basalt and sedimentary rocks. The sill comprises varieties of dolerite and gabbro analogous to the Golden Mile Dolerite. The Company completed first pass land and lake aircore. drilling in September 2021 which outlined coherent shallow supergene gold anomalism over almost five kilometres of MIRAMAR strike across multiple targets and extended the Glandore East RESOURCESLTD. footprint to the south by at least one kilometre.

It outlines existing biological and physical baseline conditions, proposed new and ongoing baseline studies to support future permitting applications, existing permits, and future regulatory and permitting requirements, including required management plans for water, site environmental monitoring, and waste disposal. In addition, this section also discusses socio-economic baseline conditions, the status of community engagement, and mine closure and reclamation planning for the Project. This information was summarized in a previously published Nl 43-101 report completed in 2020 (Santo Domingo Project, Region Ill, Chile, Nl 43-101 Technical Report). Approved environmental licences were received for the Project in 2015 and 2020 based on the scope of the Project as presented in the 2020 NIl 43-101 technical report (2020). Since that time, optimizations have been made to the 2020 Project scope, as presented in the Report, that will require Capstone to, at a later date, enter the Environmental Impact Assessment System (SElA) through an Environmental Impact Declaration (DIA), indicating the updates compared to what is currently approved. The relevant modifications to be included in the DiA with respect to the previous approvals as follows: A new connection to an alternative existing electrical substation, located adjacent to the original substation. This required a modification to the substation which is operated by a third party. An updated TsF design within the area previously approved for the facility.  Simplified tailings thickening system (one stage thickening instead of two as considered in the 2020 Project),  Minor optimizations for the other areas (mine, process plant, port, pipelines, and tailings deposit); these changes would be made within the areas already assessed in the 2015 ElA. The port area requires additional information to be collected associated with a new access road and a small effluent treatment plant for iron concentrate filtrate. The project is located in the Atacama Region, in the provinces of Copiapo and Chanaral, in the municipalities of Caldera, Chanaral and Diego de Almagro.

Sample lines radiate across the Tapley Hill formation perpendicular to stratigraphy to give a broader view of mineral distribution associated with stratigraphy and cross cutting structures. The wider soil sampling program again demonstrated the negative association between Cu and Zn enrichment (Figure 3), highlighting the possibility of a larger mineralisation event at Wyacca than initially modelled.Geochemical analysis by pXrF should be considered as a trend indicator only and the accuracy subject to confirmation by laboratory assay. Although every effort is applied to produce accurate pXrF results the results from pXRF analysis can vary significantly from. Iaboratory assay. The new samples also show the NE trend to the mineralisation, with the Cu soil anomaly around the Worrumba 21 prospect being extended by 600m (Figure 2). This area was not an initial focus for Taruga, with maiden drilling occurring at the Powder Hill and Worrumba 19 prospects which lie on the Western Tindelpina stratigraphic horizon and feature numerous historic workings and outcrop. Later field work and investigations mapped and sampled an area near Worrumba 21 workings which were subjected to limited shallow RAB and Aircore drilling to test geochemical trends and lithology. The mineralised vein system also follows a NE trend, and has been mapped to. extend a further 300m than previously recorded and has not been tested by drilling. The potential variations in vein geometry and extent of the mineralized vein system along this strike. from and below the central copper anomaly is currently unknown. The vein system is present beyond the central copper anomaly and is still open along this NE strike with further field work to investigate if Cu minerals are present in the identified veins and if veining extends further.

It is interpreted that shearing at Andy Well has developed adjacent to (and in response to) movement along the Mount Magnet Shear zone, which is located ~lkm to the east. Shearing along the northeast-southwest trend is likely to have exploited lithological contacts due to rheological contrast between differing basalt flow compositions.

        "text": "tivan asxannouncement  In respect of TIVAN+, the review will encompass the extensive body of work completed with CSIRO over the past year. and the testwork results reported today. It will evaluate the pathway to the planning and construction of a large-scale TIVAN+ Pilot Plant, including potential funding through commercial arrangements and various Australian government programs. The Board notes that the recent 2024-25 Federal Budget includes significant funding for innovative projects that build sovereign capabilities and that accelerate the energy transition. Tivan will report the findings of this comprehensive review in Q3. Meanwhile, Tivan will continue to rapidly advance the Company's strategic priorities in 2024, being the Speewah Fluorite Project and the Sandover Project. Tivan Executive Chairman Mr Grant Wilson commented:. \"A year on from our decision to break from the TivAn@ flowsheet, we are delighted to report the first testwork results of our strategic partnership with CSiRO. The results confirm the technical viability of TIVAN+ and the amenability of. the technology pathway to the Speewah resource. These are critical foundational steps and the result of extensive. collaboration between Tivan and CS/RO. The success of the testwork program means that Tivan can now evaluate the traditional salt roast pathway against the TIVAN+ technology pathway. This important exercise will occur in Q3. If we decide in favour of TIVAN+, we will move directly toward the planning and construction of a large-scale TIvAN+ Pilot Plant. From a scheduling perspective, there is scope to construct a TIVAN+ Pilot Plant whilst we are delivering the Speewah Fluorite Project. The Board of Tivan extends its congratulations to the team at CsiRO. The testwork results are fantastic and offer breakthrough achievement in critical minerals processing and would be Made in Australia'.\" This announcement has been approved by the Board of the Company..

I note we have a quorum, so I'd like to declare the meeting open. I would like to welcome our new investors PAC Partners, their Managing Director Craig Stranger and Executive Director Josh Gordon, who will be joining the board. In the short time we have known them PAC Partners have been strong financial supporters of the Company. underpinning our recent placement and rights issue. Advance Metals has a unique opportunity to commercialise and develop its two major projects in North America, in Idaho and at the Augustus, Bullard mine project in Arizona.. These have been the focus of our management team together with our joint venture partner and principal geologist Jim Guilinger. Both projects have considerable potential and in the case of Augustus, a reasonably short horizon till commercialisation which should be our focus in 2025. This will be my last annual meeting of Advanced Metals, and even though I'm standing for re-election I will be retiring in the current year. For me I am proud to have been associated with the Company and I leave it with two excellent projects and a reasonable financial position. I would like to thank our directors Denis Geldard and Mel Sanderson, our CEO Frank Bennett and our long serving chief operating officer Dominic Hill. In many ways Dom has been the soul of the company and the initiator and catalyst for our projects in North America.. Finally, I'd like to thank our shareholders particularly our longstanding (dare I say suffering). ones for their support and faith in the Company. I'm confident that this will be rewarded in the near future as we uncover the riches and potential of Augustus.

Drilling by previous companies, that included a few deeper reverse circulation holes failed to locate a bedrock source and the gold mineralisation was assumed to be displaced and not related to a proximal bedrock source.

Raptor due diligence exploration program aims to; 1. Foster strong relationships with local landowners, 2. Identify anomalous REE occurrences within the pervasive saprolite cover via soil sampling, shallow sub-surface sampling and rock chipping, 3. Execute an auger drilling program (if applicable) to test REE occurrences and grades within in-situ weathered rock profile (saprolite) beneath transported cover.  Initial results from exposed saprolite and shallow sub-surface sampling are expected in July, with deeper auger drill results from saprolite profile (if undertaken) likely to be known in August. Perpetual Resources Ltd (\"Perpetual\" or \"the Company) (Asx: PEc) is pleased to announce that it has commenced its maiden due diligence exploration program at the recently acquired Raptor REe Project, located within the prolific Caldeira complex in Minas Gerais, Brazil.

The mineralisation presented in the body of this news release is not necessarily representative of mineralisation throughout the Belltopper Gold Project. Intercepts are expressed as down- hole intersections and should not be presumed to represent true widths, which vary from hole to hole and between reefs (refer JORC Table 1).. Significant gold results span a range of mineralisation styles; including oblique to stratigraphy high-grade shear or fault related mineralisation analogous to that at Costerfield or Stawell mines; layer-parallel laminated gold-bearing quartz, quartz breccia, and west-dipping mineralised faults analogous to high-grade Victorian deposits such as at Fosterville mine; and Castlemaine goldfields. The recent drilling continues momentum garnered from current exploration efforts and the. 2021 - 2022 diamond program which discovered and delineated a gold-bearing felsic porphyry with clear IRG characteristics (confirming a new but hypothesised mineralisation style in the region); in addition to highlighting several underexplored, kilometre-scale, high-grade gold reefs with emerging shoot potential, that have in many cases only been tested by a handful of scout or reconnaissance holes at best.. The diamond drilling program was executed with a strong focus on safety, environment, and. community engagement with no incidents. All drill sites used during the program have been. rehabilitated.

Consequently, the Company believes the likely overall net-effect of these changes will result in an enhancement in post-tax NPV when compared to the DFS (all else. remaining equal). The FEED will now form the basis of the proposed project implementation plan and contracting strategy. This will. involve finalising material contracts which will include the completion of remaining detailed design work, provide fixed. price, target schedules and performance guarantees for the Project. Work has already begun on preparing these. tender packages, which will be issued under a competitive tender process. OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE THE STEEL AND VFB MARKET In addition to the opportunity to directly address the VFB market, the Company is also considering alternative value. accretive product options, including the potential to produce ammonium metavanadate (\"AMv') and other related. products such as vanadium electrolyte, vanadium nitride and ferrovanadium. The consideration of these alternatives. by the Company is in direct response to requests for supply/offtake from Chinese parties received during the. Roadshow. Commenting on the Steelpoortdrift Vanadium Project Update, Mr John Ciganek, Chief Executive of VR8 said:. \"We have always anticipated that Steelpoortdrift would be banked and developed solely on the back of the steel market, which currently accounts for 89.2%' of vanadium demand. However, after our recent Roadshow, it became evident that the demand for high-quality Vanadium Pentoxide in China for grid- scale VFB systems is significantly larger than previously estimated.Our strategic decision to enable dual product streams of 98% and 99.5% VOs is a direct response to this market demand, futureproofing Steelpoortdrift's production profile and maximising its total long-term sales value.\". Commenting on the Steelpoortdrift Vanadium Project Update, Mr Jurie Wessels, Executive Chairman of VR8 said: \"During our visit it became increasingly clear that many Chinese consumers of vanadium require a reliable supply for manufacturing products aimed at the steel market, as well as a consistent supply of high-purity vanadium for the VFB and specialist alloy markets. We left China with the impression that the domestic supply of vanadium is inconsistent, at times scarce and frequently lacks the required purity levels. As such, the perception we gained was that China's vanadium supplies are either inconsistent or inadequate, resulting in higher purification costs in the energy storage and alloy markets. Considering these supply-side complications, we firmly believe that VR8 is privileged to be advancing a world-class asset like Steelpoortdrift, given the anticipated exponential growth of VFB systems on the horizon. Thanks to its lower impurity levels, Steelpoortdrift holds a clear competitive advantage over its slag-sourced VOs counterparts in the VFB market, an advantage that VR8 intends to fully capitalise on. 6 At 13 June 2024, the current sale price for 99.5% V2Os Powdered Vanadium is CNY114,000/t versus 98.0% V2Os Flake product of CNY83,500/t. This current pricing implies a ~36% premium for 99.5% VOs product over the 98% V2Os product.

        "text": "TENNANT MINERALS Tennant Minerals Limited (\"Tennant\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to announce commencement of a major new, two phase, drilling program at the Bluebird copper-gold discovery. Bluebird is located within the Company's 1o0% owned Barkly Project, at the eastern edge of the Tennant Creek (copper-gold) Mineral Field, which produced more than 5.5Moz of gold and 7oo,ooo tonnes of copper from 1934 to 20055 (see location, Figure 1). The new program will build on Tennant's previous success at Bluebird, which has led to the delineation of significant high-grade copper and gold mineralisation over a 5o0m strike length and to a depth of more than 4o0m. The Bluebird mineralisation remains open in all directions (see Figure 2). The first phase of the drilling program will include around 4,500m of RC drilling which will test the shallow plunging, thick and high-grade gold and copper zone extending west and east of Bluebird, as well as targeting projected extensions at depth (see Figure 2). Drilling will target immediate extensions of the high-grade copper and bonanza gold zones, which are open in all directions, and will aim to build on the large number of exceptional intersections at Bluebird, including: 17.95m @ 11.1 g/t Au, 2.7% Cu from 131m incl. 5.1m @ 38.6 g/t Au, 6.1% Cu2 in BBDD0026, 61.8m @ 2.3% Cu, 0.4 g/t Au from 149.2m incl. 6.8m @ 17% Cu, 0.5 g/t Au3 in BBDD0045, 30.5m @ 6.2% Cu, 6.8 g/t Au from 153.6m incl. 17.8m @ 5.2% Cu, 11.5 g/t Au6 in BBDD0018, 63m @ 2.1% Cu, 4.6 g/t Au from 153m incl. 27.55m @ 3.6% Cu, 10.0 g/t Au' in BBDD0012, and, 24m @ 0.66% Cu, 11.8 g/t Au from 161m incl. 5.7m @ 0.74% Cu, 49.3 g/t Au in BBDD0021. Following this program, a second phase of up to 7,500m of RC and diamond drilling will expand on the current RC drilling program and test other identified targets for repeats of Bluebird within the 2.5km strike-length Bluebird-Perseverance corridor (see gravity inversion and prospect locations, Figure 3). This second phase drilling will include testing of the Perseverance target, located 1.5km west of Bluebird. The Company has been successful in obtaining a NT government \"Resourcing the Territory\" The highest intensity gravity anomaly, and coincident reversed magnetic anomaly will be tested - targeting the intersection of the mineralised Perseverance fault zone with the ironstone (see Figure 3). About Bluebird: The mineralisation intersected at Bluebird is typical of the high-grade copper-gold orebodies in the Tennant Creek Mineral Field (Figure 1), such as the Peko copper-gold deposit which produced 3.7Mt @ 4% Cu, 3.5 g/t Au historically5. The high-grade mineralisation, developed from approximately 80m below surface, is associated with intense hematite alteration and brecciation with quartz veining inside a halo of chlorite alteration and variable hematite development. The upper parts of the mineralised zones include secondary malachite (copper-carbonate) as well as native copper, which transitions to primary sulphide mineralisation at depth including chalcocite, bornite and chalcopyrite (e.g. the massive chalcopyrite zone in BBDDo0186). Metallurgical testing has been completed and indicates the amenability of the Bluebird materials to standard copper flotation, producing copper and gold concentrates comparable with commercially available products'. Further work is in progress to enhance gold recovery, which will include gravity concentration test-work and cyanide leaching of the flotation tail. The Company will also examine and silver. 3 ",

Sampling identified a large (>200m length by 20m wide) pegmatite with anomalous LCT-style geochemistry best result: 573ppm Li; 1385ppm Rb; 41.6ppm Cs; 331ppm Sn; and 148ppm Ta (MR00465) at Garden Creek on E45/5869. Follow-up reconnaissance over the anomalous soil sample (100ppm) areas failed to return any significant. assay results.The anomalous soil results are interpreted to be associated with alteration and concentration of mica minerals about geological contacts. MinRex Resources Limited (Asx:MRR)(\"MinRex\" or\"the Company') has received and interpreted the assay results from the recently completed reconnaissance rock chip sampling program over the Garden Creek and Sisters tenements at its. Marble Bar Lithium Project.. The Marble Bar projects cover an area of 71km2 comprising the Sisters tenement (E45/5871), Garden Creek tenement (E45/5869) and Talga tenement (E45/5873), which are located within a 30km radius of the Marble Bar town site (refer Figure 1). The Marble Bar projects are considered to be prospective for hard rock, lithium-caesium-tantalum (LCT) type  pegmatites, with the Sisters and Garden Creek tenements situated 2km east and 8km north respectively of the Global Lithium Ltd (ASX:GL1) Archer Deposit which hosts 18.0 million tonnes at 1.0% Li2O. The Sisters and Garden Creek tenements cover portions of the fertile Marble Bar Greenstone belt.

The rock chip samples were assayed for 48 multi-elements, including the usual suite of LCT pathfinder elements. At the Sisters tenement the rock chip sampling was undertaken over the 4-5 broad zones defined by a cluster of 100ppm lithium (Li) from previous soil geochemical sampling (see ASx Announcement 22 November 2023 Soil Sampling Results Received for Marble Bar Project). Field observations and assay results confirm that generally the elevated lithium from. McPhee Formation) containing the elevated Li with granites of the Homeward Bound Granite (refer Figure 2 and Table 1). The lithium assays at the Sisters tenement range between 5.3ppm and 66ppm Li (median 25ppm Li). The median lithium of the rock chip samples was around 50% that of the soils and likely represents an upgrading through liberation of mica due to weathering of the host rocks in the soil profile. Reconnaissance exploration at the Garden Creek tenement identified a large (200m length by 20m wide) pegmatite collected from different mineralogical zones across the pegmatite. The best result was 573ppm Li; 1385ppm Rb; 41.6ppm Cs; 331ppm Sn; and 148ppm Ta from sample MR00465 (refer Figures 3 & 4 and Table 1). Sample MR00465 was from a Iarge micaceous zone within the pegmatite and the lithium, and other elevated elements may reflect a more fractionated anomalous LCT-style assays..

The program was designed to follow up the opportunity identified in the PFS to potentially increase Ore Reserves through additional infill drilling.. The BC pit design is limited by the current depth of Indicated Mineral Resources, with substantial Inferred Mineral Resources situated just below. Pit optimisation sensitivities highlighted that the optimal pit shell. would expand if Inferred Mineral Resources were also included in the optimisation runs, and therefore, upgrading these Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated could increase Ore Reserves. This announcement includes results from 6 DD holes and 14 RC holes for a total of 2,047m drilled, with assays pending from the remaining holes of BC's infill drilling program. Multiple positive intercepts were recorded, with results summarised in Figure 2 and described in further detail below. Page 2 of 21 ",

There is also a risk of legal or other disputes between the Company and co-venturers or contractors or other suppliers. This may have an adverse effect on the interests and prospects of the Company. (I) Input pricing and availability. The timing and cost of inputs to mining businesses, including consultants, people. equipment, construction materials and consumables, vary with demand and supply and has historically been tight when commodity prices rise. Inflationary impacts on mining inputs may result in increased capital and operating cost or delays to the project. (m) Technology and performance risk. The scope for development of the Razorback project relies on third party technology and. design, some of it proprietary. The Company is currently conducting metallurgical testing and while testing to date has been encouraging, there is no guarantee or assurance that processing outcomes will be replicated at commercial scale, with potential impacts to throughput, quality and costs.. (n) Regulatory risk Changes in government policy (such as in relation to taxation, environmental and cultural protection, and licensing) or statutory changes may affect Magnetite Mines' business operations and its financial position. A change in government regime may significantly result in changes to fiscal, monetary, property rights and other issues which may result. in a material adverse or positive impact on Magnetite Mines' business. Magnetite Mines monitors changes in relevant regulations and engages with regulators and governments to ensure policy and law changes are appropriately influenced and understood. (0) Permit risk of relevant government bodies and ongoing compliance with licence terms and conditions. Tenure management processes and standard operating procedures are operating approvals for which the extensive preparatory work is underway. Major new consents and licences will need to be secured pursuant to the SA Mining Act 1971, while other regulatory approvals and consents (State and/or Commonwealth) may also be required. As with any approval process, consent is not guaranteed and conditions or other consent requirements may impact the project timing and outcomes. (d) Land access, cultural heritage, Native Title and community stakeholders Magnetite Mines is required to notify owners and occupiers of land within its licence areas prior to undertaking exploration works and must negotiate access conditions prior to commencing mine development activities. There is a risk that any negotiations with owners and occupiers regarding access could be protracted and/or costly. Magnetite Mines operates in a number of areas within South Australia that are subject to Native Title determination or claim. Native title rights are acknowledged by Magnetite Mines and the Company must comply with relevant obligations under Federal and State regulation.A Native Title agreement is generally required before the commencement of exploration activities upon a tenement or prior to the granting of a mining lease; consequently, this may impact the timing and cost of exploration, development and production. Magnetite Mines notes that it already has a relevant agreement in place for exploration activities upon the Razorback tenements and negotiation for a mining agreement is scheduled into the development process. The iron ore industry is also subject to interest from a wide range of stakeholders from the broader community who may be opposed to the role of the industry. Magnetite Mines' standard operating procedures and stakeholder engagement processes are used to manage land access, cultural heritage, native title and community stakeholder risks. The Company actively engages with its stakeholders and monitors for any emerging risks. 23 ",

The Company has designed an initial 3,oo0m reverse-circulation drilling program to test the highest- priority targets and will continue to interrogate the data to define further areas of interest. Drilling is. to be undertaken following budget approval, heritage survey and earth works. 54000 50 x 50m Gravity Grid 25  25m Gravity Grid Rock Chip Samples (Li20%) 0-0.01 0.01-0.05 0.05-0.1 0.1-0.5 0.5-1 1-2 02-5 Mapped Pegmatites Pegmatite Targets 0.5 35200 Figure 1: West Spargoville Project 1VD Gravity Image.

Bastion's Split Rock Dam Project is considered highly prospective for gold, with an undrilled arsenic zone in historical soil samples containing values up to 295 ppm over 1 km, along the. faulted NW trending contact between basalt and granite. Soil sampling has defined elevated lithium to 120 ppm north of the post-tectonic granite (Agl). identified in government mapping. Elevated tantalum (to 18 ppm), rubidium (to 234 ppm), tin. (to 13 ppm) and cerium (to 115 ppm) occur in the south of the soil grid. Bastion Minerals Limited (ASx: BMO) (Bastion or the Company), a multi-commodity company building a broad portfolio of battery metals projects, is pleased to provide an update on the highly prospective Split Rock Dam project in the well know Mt Ida region of Western Australian Commenting on the latest results, Executive Chairman, Mr Ross Landles, said: \"Bastion is pleased to have received soil sample results for the highly prospective Split Rock Dam project in the Mt Ida region. The Project was previously not explored for lithium or rare earth minerals. The soil survey returned zones of elevated lithium in the north of the survey, and another zone in the south of the soil grid with elevated lithium, tantalum, rubidium, and cerium, associated with the posi tectonic granite recognised there.\" \"Recognition of this element association, with elevated concentrations, is highly positive. We are also extremely interested in the undrilled extensive historical arsenic zone extending over 1 km, along the NW trending contact between basalt and granite. This provides an excellent target for gold mineralisation. Background The Split Rock Dam Project (Figures 1 and 2) property, E16/607, is located in the Mt Ida region, near the western margin of the Norseman-Wiluna Greenstone Belt, and the boundary between the Kalgoorlie Terrane and the Barlee Domain of the Eastern Goldfields and Southern Cross Province property of interest as a possible source for lithium LCT mineralisation.

Initial assay results are expected in August 2024, with planned follow-up drilling once assays are. received.  Reconnaissance drilling has extended the Gifford Creek Carbonatite by 5km to the south. An aircore drill program is being planned for testing for oxide niobium enrichment within the. extension (Figure 3). RC drilling of the Tiger Cu-Au-Zn-Ag target has commenced. Drilling of other Mangaroon gold targets is to follow. Dreadnought Resources Limited (\"Dreadnought') is pleased to announce that RC drilling. has been completed at the Gifford Creek Carbonatite, part of the Mangaroon project Iocated in the Gascoyne Region of Western Australia. Dreadnought's Managing Director, Dean Tuck, commented: \"The Gifford Creek Carbonatite has produced some of WA's. best niobium intercepts outside the Arunta Province.With strong niobium identified across multiple zones, we see the potential for Mangaroon to evolve as a multi-commodity critical metals hub within proximity to existing infrastructure with mutual benefit to pastoralists, existing ports and neighboring projects. We look forward to receiving the assays from this program and designing. follow up programs after our gold and base metal drilling, which is currently underway.\" Figure I: Photo of the Topdrill RC rig drilling at the Stinger niobium target. dreadnoughtresources.com.au ",

The planned network connection point is at a new substation located 2km north of the existing TransGrid Parkes 132kV substation. The new substation is planned to be constructed to support a new solar farm project (Quorn Park) and other future large connections such as the Parkes Special Activation Precinct. Connecting to this new substation shortens the Projects transmission line by 1.5 km and results in a simplified connection process.. Early earthworks on the Quorn Park solar farm commenced in February 2024 with operations targeted to commence. in mid-2025 The Consolidated Entity's technical consultants, GHD, completed the first draft of the power systems studies that are network can support the Sunrise Project's forecast load and minimal upstream network augmentation will be required. These studies have been submitted to NSW network operator, Essential Energy, for review.. Work was also completed on the Oversize Transport Route Study. The study was undertaken to deliver surveyed plans and designs of civil and overhead services modifications required along the oversized transport route from Port Pirie to the Project site, with engagement with key road and power authorities continuing throughout the financial year. A $5oo,000 grant towards the cost of the Oversize Transportation Route Study was awarded to the Consolidated Entity pursuant to Stream 1 (Project Activation Studies) of the NSw Government's Critical Minerals and High-Tech Metals Activation Fund, which aims to support activities which will activate the critical minerals and high-tech metals sector in New South Wales To date the Consolidated entity has drawn down $425,000 of that grant, with a claim filed for the final $75,000 at financial. year end. In late FY23 the Consolidated Entity drilled a number of bores at the Sunrise Project borefield, 60km south of the project. processing water utilising the Consolidated Entity's existing ground water extraction licences. The Consolidated Entity has agreements in place with Forbes and Lachlan shire councils for the placement of a water pipeline from the borefield to the project. Compulsory pump testing of the three production bores installed in FY23 was completed in February 2024. The pump testing indicated that the production bores are expected to comfortably deliver the required flow rate required for operation of the Sunrise Project. The Consolidated Entity also continued to progress commercial discussions with landowners, Aboriginal Land Councils, local councils, the NSw State Government and other impacted parties required for land access agreements for key infrastructure including the Sunrise Project water pipeline and ETL. 10 ",

The known strike of mineralisation to date is ~l.6km and remains open down plunge. A trial of downhole electromagnetics ('DHem') was conducted on select holes at the Ming Mine to assess the ability of the technique to identify areas of known mineralisation. The trial surveys were successful in highlighting zones of high-grade mineralisation confirmed by diamond drilling (see ASX release dated 3 September 2024).

The optimised design is expected to reduce the height of the Jameson Cell installation and reduce the associated bulk material quantities and capital cost. 24.4.6 Integrated Tailings Thickeners-TsF assessment The current tailings thickening design considers high density thickeners type of equipment. Tailings physical properties and site conditions influence the TSF wall design. There is an opportunity to have a reduction in TSF wall volume, improving water recovery, and reducing sectoral permitting requirements and time by implementing paste thickening technology, which has a higher total installed cost associated. Trade-offs are to be conducted and further developed to support a decision in relation to this. 24.5 Mantoverde-Santo Domingo Mining District Integration After the ramp-up of MVDP at the end of 2024, Capstone's next phase of transformational growth will be a construction decision and integration of the Project with the expanded Mantoverde Mine. Capstone aims to create a 250 ktpa of copper cathode and concentrate (consolidated Mantoverde and Santo Domingo) world-class mining district in the Atacama region of Chile (MV-sD). The combination of key infrastructure already in place alongside an experienced mine build and operating team supports future development of the MV-sD district. Capstone's base case plan for MV-SD district integration includes completion and ramp-up of MVDP (Capstone, 2024) a sanctioning decision followed by construction of the Santo Domingo Project's copper-iron project, and completion of upgrades to the existing water and power infrastructure proximal to both projects. Santo Domingo is located 35 km northeast of Capstone's Mantoverde Mine, approximately 65 km via public roadways, and 16 km southeast of Capstone's Sierra Norte property. 24.5.1 Mantoverde Mine Mantoverde Mine is a copper-gold producer, with 70% ownership held by Capstone and 30% held by Mitsubishi Materials Corporation, described in the \"Mantoverde Mine and Mantoverde Development Project NI 43-101 Technical Report Chanaral / Region de Atacama, Chile\", effective November 29, 2021. The Mantoverde Development Project (MvDP) expansion is expected to increase production at Mantoverde Mine from approximately 35,000 tonnes of copper as cathodes in 2023 to approximately 110,000 tones of copper per yea combining cathodes and concentrate at full capacity. MvDP is a conventional open pit operation using truck-and-shovel technology. A concentrator plant was constructed in 2023 to treat sulphide ore. Copper concentrate production is expected to begin in the second half of 2024. Oxide ores will continue to be treated in the existing solvent extraction and electrowinning plant (SX-EW). MVDP is progressing under a lump-sum turn-key EPCM contract with Ausenco Limited. The Mantoverde Mine will be able to use the planned Santo Domingo port to ship concentrate.

Exploration completed on the Salitre project by the Gold Mountain team consists of grid soil sampling and reconnaissance geological mapping in the Salitre North and Salitre South areas (see Figure 2)1.. The soil sampling was carried out in three separate phases. The initial phase consists of five 1o0m spaced Nw-SE lines with samples collected every 25m at Salitre South. The second phase consists of 855 samples collected every 50m along 400m spaced east-west lines at Salitre North. The most recent phase of sampling is 200m spaced infill soil lines at Salitre North plus extending the grid a further 1.6km to the south. The Salitre North sampling grid now covers approximately 6km by 2.0km with 6 lines traversing the full width of the licence area. A gap of approximately 3.5km remains between the Salitre North and Salitre South sampling grids. The soil sampling has highlighted a prominent 4.5km long by 1km wide +60ppm lithium anomaly at Salitre North with assays up to 111.5ppm Li against a background grade of less than 30ppm (see Figure 3). There are also strong correlations between lithium and beryllium (0.82), caesium (0.71), niobium 0.77) and tin 0.73) plus moderate correlations with scandium (0.67) and rubidium (0.55) - all positive indicators for lithium bearing pegmatites. The Salitre North anomaly has a pronounced north-south trend and potentially extends to Salitre South where soil zone between Salitre North and South is mineralised.. A second lithium soil anomaly is evident to the east of the main anomaly at Salitre North with grades of over 75ppm Li. This anomaly is outlined by 400m spaced soil lines only and requires infill sampling to better define the target. 871755/2022 871756/2022 Tenement Boundary Soil Sample Locations Figure 2: Salitre lithium project soil sample locations 1 See Gold Mountain Limited ASX announcements dated 12 October 2023 & 30 October 2023 ",

Rich Mining History: High-grade production history with notable yields, including 54,500 tonnes at 8.5 g/t Au in the 1930s and 95,000 tonnes at 6.7 g/t Au in the 1980s.  Proven Gold Mineralisation: Recent exploration has identified both shallow and deep gold targets, indicating strong potential for significant resource expansion. Potential Untapped High-Grade Potential: Recent exploration has identified the potential for multiple high-grade shoots within a strike extensive mineralised corridor, significantly enhancing the resource potential. Significant Exploration Upside: With historical surface drilling not sufficiently testing depth extent, the mineralisation remains open down-plunge to the north and at depth, offering substantial discovery opportunities Expansive Exploration Targets: Recent soil analyses and IP surveys have identified numerous drill targets across the largely untested 20 km strike, positioning Cowarra as a prime candidate for large-scale gold discoveries.
