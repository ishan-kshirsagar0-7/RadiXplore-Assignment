# I tried out an approach in which the Gemini LLM would just return the location (place name) of the project, and then I'd use a gazetteer
# to find out the coordinates, but I ended up not following through with this idea. The very reason I tried this out, was because - asking
# Gemini to directly search coordinates of all project names (from all 5 report pdfs at the same time) was taking up too much time 
# (âˆ¼60-65 seconds). I thought maybe this approach would potentially save me some time by offloading the coordinate extraction process to
# a gazetter instead, but it turns out, Gemini still took 80-90 seconds to return those location names. Also, even if the names were correctly
# extracted by Gemini, the gazetter failed to retrieve coordinates quite frequently.
